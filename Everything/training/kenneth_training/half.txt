Pull the bag off to the side to avoid making peaks on the top. For the stems, press out a tiny bit of meringue onto the other sheet, then pull the bag straight up. They should resemble candy kisses. Do not worry about making all of the pieces exactly the same. The mushrooms will look more natural if the pieces are different sizes. Dust the mushroom caps lightly with cocoa using a small sifter or strainer.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the caps are dry enough to easily remove from the cookie sheets. Set aside to cool completely. Melt the coating chocolate in a metal bowl over simmering water, or in a glass bowl in the microwave, stirring occasionally until smooth.
Poke a small hole in the bottom of a mushroom cap. Spread chocolate over the bottom of the cap. Dip the tip of a stem in chocolate, and press lightly into the hole. When the chocolate sets, they will hold together. Repeat with remaining pieces. Store at room temperature in a dry place or tin.

1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9x9 inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Line pan with 2 overlapping layers of parchment, leaving a 2 inch overhang on all sides. Coat parchment with nonstick spray.
Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl. Melt butter in a medium heatproof bowl in the microwave or in a medium pot over medium heat. Immediately add hot butter to sugar mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously with spoon or spatula after each addition, until batter is thick, shiny, and smooth. Stir in molasses and vanilla. Using a sifter or fine-mesh sieve, sift in flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and cloves. Stir until well incorporated, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes.
Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Bake brownie until top is firm to the touch, edges are set, center is moist but not uncooked, and a tester or paring knife inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs (not runny batter) attached, 25â25 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack and let brownie cool completely in pan. Using parchment overhang, lift brownie out of pan and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 16 squares.

1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/4 cups dried, bright orange apricots (about 8 ounces), halved
1 1/4 cups Luxardo or maraschino cherries (about 7 ounces), halved, rinsed, patted dry
1 1/4 cups unsalted pistachios (about 6 ounces), coarsely chopped
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate (70â72% cacao), coarsely chopped
5 large eggs, room temperature
1 1/2 cups sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
4 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream
Pinch of kosher salt
1 tablespoons brandy (optional)
A 9 inch round cake pan; a cake board

Spray a large bowl (at least 12-cup capacity; the stainless steel bowl of a stand mixer is perfect) with nonstick spray, then line with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang.
Heat corn syrup, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low until sugar is melted. Increase heat to medium and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 240 degrees F, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed (or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Reduce mixer speed to low and carefully add sugar syrup to egg whites in a slow and steady stream. Increase speed to high and beat until mixture is light, glossy, and fluffy, 6â8 minutes.
Using electric mixer on high speed, beat cream cheese in another large bowl until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add heavy cream, milk, vanilla, and salt and beat until smooth.
Whisk oneâthird of meringue into cream cheese mixture to lighten. Gently fold remaining meringue into cream cheese mixture. Fold in apricots, cherries, and pistachios.
Pour mixture into prepared bowl, smooth top, then bring plastic up and over bombe, pressing against bottom of bowl to compact. Freeze until hard, at least 12 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat cake pan with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.
Heat butter and chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring, until chocolate is melted and smooth.
Using electric mixer on medium speed, beat eggs and sugar in another large bowl until pale and tripled in volume, 10â12 minutes.
Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, orange zest, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk dry ingredients into chocolate mixture until well combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold about one-third of egg mixture into chocolate mixture to lighten, then fold chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture until combined.
Pour batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Bake cake until center is set and sides are beginning to brown, 45â50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool completely in pan (cake will sink a little in the center as it cools).
Trim cake board to fit inside bowl with mousse (slightly smaller than diameter of bowl). Remove cake from pan and trim to flatten top, then trim to size of cake board. Place cake on board, then place board on a wire rack set on a sheet tray.
Rub bowl with a very hot, wet towel to defrost slightly; remove plastic wrap from top of bowl. Invert bowl upside down on top of cake. Using plastic, gently pull so mousse comes free; adjust to center mousse on cake, if needed. Peel off plastic.
Place chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat cream in a small pot over medium until hot but not boiling. Pour over chocolate, let sit 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Add salt and brandy (if using) and stir to combine.
Spoon glaze over bombe, letting it drip over sides to coat thoroughly.
Transfer bombe to a platter. Cut into wedges with a hot dry knife (run knife under hot water and wipe dry between slices).
Mousse bombe can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen. Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Frosted Malt-Chocolate Cookies
10 ounces semisweet chocolate wafers (disks, pistoles, fÃ¨ves; about 2 cups), divided
3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons malted milk powder
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for parchment paper
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
2/3 cup plus 1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
Flaky sea salt
A 1 1/2-inch-diameter cookie cutter

Pulse 6 oz. chocolate wafers in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl.
Pulse brown sugar, cocoa powder, malted milk powder, baking powder, kosher salt, and 2 cups flour in food processor several times to combine. Add butter and pulse until pieces are broken up into bits no larger than a pea. Add to bowl with chocolate and toss to combine.
Stir vanilla and 2/3 cup cream in a measuring glass to combine, then slowly drizzle over chocolate mixture, mixing with a fork all the while. Mixture will look dry once youâve added all the cream. Knead dough a few times in the bowl (it will not come together and will look crumbly), then transfer to a large piece of plastic wrap. Bring the edges of plastic up and over dough and press down to incorporate floury parts, then wrap tightly. Use the heel of your hand to press down firmly on the dough, forcing it to tightly fill out the plastic. This will help the dough adhere into a single mass and help the flour hydrate. Chill dough until firm, at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out dough between 2 sheets of floured parchment paper to 3/4 inch thick (you might not have to roll it very much). Punch out rounds with cookie cutter as close together as possible. Transfer biscuits to a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze 10 minutes.
Bake biscuits, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until firm to the touch around the edges, 13â18 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet.
Meanwhile, heat corn syrup, remaining 4 oz. chocolate, and remaining 1/2 cup cream in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (bowl should not be touching the water), stirring often, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth. Set bowl with frosting into a large bowl of ice water and let cool, stirring occasionally, until thickened but still pourable and shiny. Spoon a scant tablespoonful of frosting onto each biscuit; sprinkle with sea salt.
Dough can be made 1 day ahead; keep chilled. Biscuits (without frosting) can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.

Spiced and Glazed Molasses Cookies
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons finely ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling
1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 large egg, room temperature
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon mild-flavored (light) molasses
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon (or more) milk
Raw sugar (for sprinkling)

Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and 1 1/2 tsp. pepper in a medium bowl to combine.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed,beat brown sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and beat to incorporate. Add 1/3 cup molasses and mix just to combine. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients; beat just until incorporated. Pat dough together and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Scoop out level tablespoonfuls of dough and roll between the palms of your hands into smooth balls. Place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2 inch apart (you should be able to fit about 12 on each sheet).
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until just firm around the edges, 9â12 minutes (if you like chewier cookies, bake less, and if a crispier cookie is your thing, bake a little longer). Let cookies cool about 5 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.
Repeat with remaining dough, using fresh parchment paper on baking sheets.
Whisk powdered sugar, milk, and remaining 1 Tbsp. molasses in a medium bowl until smooth. The glaze should be very thick and glossy but still pourable. If needed, add more milk or water 1/2-teaspoonful at a time until you get to the right consistency. Drizzle glaze over cookies and sprinkle with raw sugar and more pepper.
Cookies can be baked and glazed 2 days ahead. Once glaze is set, store airtight at room temperature, or freeze unglazed cookies up to 1 month in resealable plastic bags.

Cranberry Spice  inchTurkey inch Cupcakes with Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting
1 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1/4 cup water
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
6 ounces cream cheese
1/4 pound each brown, white, black, and orange fondant
Fondant roller
Piping gel
144 pieces of candy corn

To make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350ËF, and line two cupcake pans with twelve paper baking cups each. Sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
Add each egg slowly, one at a time, mixing after each addition.
Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, followed by one third of the water. Mix slowly. Then add another third of the flour mixture, followed by another third of the water. Mix slowly again. Finally, add the last third of the flour mixture and the last third of the water. Mix until all the ingredients are incorporated.
Scrape down the bowl, and add the cranberries. Fold in using a spatula until the cranberries are scattered throughout the batter.
Using a standard-size ice cream scoop, fill each baking cup so that it is two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Let the cupcakes cool and then frost with Georgetown Cupcake's signature swirl (see note)
In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer, mix all the ingredients for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, until frosting is light and airy. Frost each cupcake with a thick layer of the frosting using an offset spatula.
Roll out a small ball of brown fondant, approximately the size of a golf ball, to form the body of your turkey. Then roll out a ball of brown fondant, approximately half the size of the first ball, to form the head of your turkey. Attach the head to the body using piping gel or water.
Roll out two small balls of white fondant, each approximately the size of a pea, to form the eyeballs of your turkey.
Roll out two small balls of black fondant, each approximately the size of half a pea, to form the pupils of your turkeyâs eyes. Using piping gel or water, attach the pupils to the eyeballs, and the eyeballs to the turkeyâs head.
Roll out a small piece of orange fondant, and shape it into a crescent to form the turkeyâs beak. Attach it to the turkeyâs head using piping gel or water.
Roll out four small pieces of brown fondant and shape them into rounded teardrops to form feathers.
Let the fondant turkey and feathers set for 5 to 10 minutes, and then place the turkey on top of a cupcake, with the feathers placed behind.
Line up six pieces of candy corn, pointed side down on the brown fondant feathers behind the turkeyâs body to form another layer of feathers.

Hazelnut Lace Sandwich Cookies
1/2 cup blanched hazelnuts
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/3 cup blueberry jam, strained
Finely grated zest of 1 lime

Pulse hazelnuts, flour, and salt in a food processor until nuts are finely ground; set aside.
Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until butter foams, then browns, about 5 minutes. Let cool about 5 minutes, then add granulated sugar, cream, maple syrup, vanilla, and 1 Tbsp. water and stir to incorporate. Return saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil; cook, without stirring, 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir in hazelnut mixture. Scrape batter into a medium heatproof bowl and let cool, stirring occasionally to reincorporate the butter.
Meanwhile, place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325 degrees F.
Scoop out rounded teaspoonfuls of batter and roll between the palms of your hands into smooth balls. Place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets at least 3 inch apart. Because these cookies spread so much during baking, give each ball plenty of space. You should be able to fit 8 per sheet and will need to bake in 2 batches for a total of 32 cookies.
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until they spread into thin lacy disks and are deep golden brown around the edges, 10â14 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Repeat with remaining batter, using fresh parchment paper on baking sheets.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter in a medium bowl until light, about 1 minute. Add powdered sugar and beat until pale, about 30 seconds. Add jam about 1 tablespoonful at a time, beating until smooth after each addition, then beat in lime zest.
Carefully remove cooled cookies from parchment. Using a small offset spatula, spread 1â2 tsp. filling across flat sides of half of cookies. Top with remaining cookies to create sandwiches.
Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature, separated by layers of parchment paper to prevent sticking.

Simple Vanilla Jam Drops
1 x quantity unrolled Vanilla Snap Cookie dough
1/2 cup (160g) raspberry jam

Place the butter, sugar and vanilla in a food processor and process until smooth.
Add the flour, egg and extra egg yolk and process until a smooth dough forms.
Preheat oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F). Roll tablespoons of the dough into balls and place on lightly greased baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper. Flatten slightly and, using your fingertip, make an indent in each round. Fill each indent with 1/4 teaspoon of the jam. Bake for 12â14 minutes or until golden. Allow to cool on trays for 10 minutes before transferring onto wire racks to cool completely.

1/3 cup (3 ounces) creamy peanut butter, such as Skippy
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
2 large egg whites (1/4 cup (2 1/4 ounces))
6 tablespoons | 3 ounces unsalted butter, creamy and softâabout 68 degrees F
1/3 cup | 3 ounces creamy peanut butter, such as Skippy
1 tablespoon | 3/4 ounce honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
1 cup | 4 ounces organic powdered sugar, sifted

Sift flour (if using a cup measure, spoon into the cup and level with a knife before sifting).
Combine butter, peanut butter, sugar, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Beat the whites with a fork until foamy and thin, then add to the butter and sugar in four additions, letting each incorporate before adding the next. Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Sprinkle in the flour, and mix to form a soft dough.
Knead against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball, divide in half, and flatten into discs. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. On a flour-dusted surface, roll the dough until 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle with flour, flip, sprinkle again, and roll just shy of 1/8 inch. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen. Cut into  inchpeanuts inch with a 3-inch bikini cookie cutter (see Cooks' Note) or into simple 2 1/4-inch rounds and arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 1/4 inch between them. If you like, gently score the cutouts with a bench scraper to make a diamond pattern. Gather scraps, re-roll, and cut as before. The remaining scraps can also be baked, to grind for crumbs.
Bake until wafers are firm and dry, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on the baking sheet. Use immediately, or transfer to an airtight container and store for up to a week at room temperature or a month in the fridge.
Combine butter, peanut butter, honey, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then sprinkle in the powdered sugar a little at a time. Once fully incorporated, increase to medium and beat until the creme is soft and light, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater halfway through. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.
Pipe 1/4 ounce (2 teaspoons) creme into the center of half of the rounds or 1/8 ounce (1 teaspoon) into each  inchlobe inch of a peanut. Sandwich with the remaining wafers; there are extras to account for breakage. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until the filling has set, about 15 minutes. Store up to 1 week at room temperature or up to a month in the fridge; serve at room temperature.
Cookie Crumbs: Grind broken wafers and scraps in a food processor until fine; freeze in a quart zip-top bag for up to 6 months. Use to replace the graham cracker crumbs in SoufflÃ©ed Cheesecake or bake into a crumb crust.
Vegan: Replace the butter in the dough and filling with an equal amount of refined coconut oil and omit the egg whites in the dough. Refrigerate for 15 minutes before rolling the dough.
Gluten-Free: Replace the all-purpose flour with 4 ounces (1 1/4 cups) oat flour, 3 ounces (2/3 cup) white rice flour, and 2 ounces (1/2 cup) coconut flour.

2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/3 cups mayonnaise
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pound, 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 cup refined coconut oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
1 pound, 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
2 candy canes, lightly crushed
2 (9 inch) round cake pans; a 1 inch pastry brush

Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.
Whisk applesauce and 1 tsp. baking powder in a small bowl. Mix chocolate and cocoa powder in a medium bowl. Pour 1 3/4 cups boiling water over and whisk until chocolate is melted. Sift flour, baking soda, salt, and remaining 1/4 tsp. baking powder into another medium bowl.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat mayonnaise, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl (or use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment) until well blended, about 3 minutes. Add half of applesauce mixture and beat to blend. Add remaining applesauce mixture, then beat in vanilla. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with chocolate mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients, beating to blend after each addition and occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. Divide batter among prepared pans; smooth top.
Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until center is set and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40â45 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes. Run a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool.
Heat chocolate, coconut oil, vanilla, and salt in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Whisk in peppermint extract and 1/4 cup water. Chill, stirring every 5 minutes, until frosting thickens, about 25 minutes. If frosting gets too thick, gently reheat over pot of simmering water.

Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers
3/4 cup (5 1/2 ounces) sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup (3 ounces) golden syrup, such as Lyleâs, sorghum, unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap), or honey
1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, solid but creamyâabout 70 degrees F
2 1/2 cups (12 ounces) whole wheat flour (not stone-ground or white whole wheat), plus more for dusting

Combine sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, golden syrup, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.
Scrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.
For grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.
Bake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months.
Chocolate: My mom used to sandwich chocolate graham crackers with peanut butter for an after-school snack, a combo I re-create by reducing the whole wheat flour to 10 ounces (21/4 cups), sifted with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) natural or Dutch-process cocoa powder. To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.
Cinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friendâs house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to Â½ teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.
Coconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamyâabout 70 degrees F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.
Gingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.
Graham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350 degrees F until firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature for immediate use in your favorite recipe, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
Gluten-Free: Replace the whole wheat flour with 6 ounces (11/4 cups) white rice flour, 4 ounces (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) oat flour, and 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) kinako.

Caramel Apple Drip Cake with Candied Walnuts
1 cup raw walnuts
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 medium apples (such as Gala, Honeycrisp, or Pink Lady), peeled, coarsely grated
1 cup buttermilk, room temperature
4 large eggs, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup granulated sugar, divided
2 cups raw walnut halves
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch of kosher salt
Classic Cream Cheese Frosting
2 (8 inch) round cake pans

Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Spread walnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden brown and aromatic, 5â8 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, lightly coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg in a medium bowl.
Pulse walnuts and 1/2 cup dry ingredients in a food processor until walnuts are chopped into a fine flour. Transfer chopped walnuts to bowl with remaining dry ingredients. Mix apples and buttermilk in another medium bowl.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until pale and thick, about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium-low and gradually stream in oil. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with apple mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Divide batter between prepared pans; smooth top.
Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40â45 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes. Run a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool completely.
Spread granulated sugar in a thin layer in the center of a large dry skillet. Cook over medium heat, mostly undisturbed (it's okay to swirl pan gently to get sugar to melt evenly), until sugar is melted, about 10 minutes. Quickly stir in walnuts and cook, stirring, until coated and melted sugar is chestnut brown, about 1 minute more. Scrape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread out to cool, separating walnut halves into individual pieces. Transfer half of nuts to a food processor and coarsely chop.
Bring granulated sugar, corn syrup, and 2 Tbsp. water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Continue to cook, without stirring, until medium amber in color, about 6 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat or warm in microwave 45 seconds.
Remove saucepan with sugar from heat and carefully whisk in cream, stirring from the center outward, until well combined. Stir in butter. Add vanilla and salt and stir to combine. Transfer caramel to a heatproof container and let cool until thickened.
Spread 1 Tbsp. frosting in the center of a platter. Place 1 cake, domed side down, on platter. Spread 1 1/4 cups frosting evenly over top. Top with 1 cup chopped candied walnuts, reserving whole candied walnuts. Place remaining cake, domed side down, on top. Spread top and sides with 2 cups frosting. Chill 30 minutes to let frosting set.
Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Chill at least 30 minutes or up to overnight to let frosting set.
Place a spoonful of caramel sauce on top of cake near one edge. Using the bottom of the spoon, spread it out, then very gently press a little sauce over the edge. Move spoon around perimeter of cake slightly and repeat to create additional drips, rotating cake as you work and spreading excess sauce across top of cake. When entire cake is covered in drips, add remaining sauce to fully cover top.
Chill at least 30 minutes to let glaze set. Decorate top and sides of cake with remaining whole walnuts and serve.
Cake can be made 3 days ahead; wrap tightly in plastic and chill, or freeze up to 2 weeks. Caramel can be made up to 2 weeks ahead; cover and chill.

Olive Oil Cake
1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil; plus more for pan
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar; plus more
2 cups cake flour
1/3 cup almond flour or meal or fine-grind cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons amaretto, Grand Marnier, sweet vermouth, or other liqueur
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest
3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 large eggs
A 9 inch-diameter springform pan

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Drizzle bottom and sides of pan with oil and use your fingers to coat. Line bottom with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate air bubbles; coat parchment with more oil. Generously sprinkle pan with sugar and tilt to coat in an even layer; tap out excess. Whisk cake flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl to combine and eliminate any lumps. Stir together amaretto, lemon juice, and vanilla in a small bowl.
Using an electric mixer on high speed (use whisk attachment if working with a stand mixer), beat eggs, lemon zest, and 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl until mixture is very light, thick, pale, and falls off the whisk or beaters in a slowly dissolving ribbon, about 3 minutes if using a stand mixer and about 5 minutes if using a hand mixer. With mixer still on high speed, gradually stream in 1Â¼ cups oil and beat until incorporated and mixture is even thicker. Reduce mixer speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with amaretto mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Fold batter several times with a large rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of bowl. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top, and sprinkle with more sugar.
Place cake in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until top is golden brown, center is firm to the touch, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40â50 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes.
Poke holes all over top of cake with a toothpick or skewer and drizzle with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil; let it absorb. Run a thin knife around edges of cake and remove ring from pan. Slide cake onto rack and let cool completely. For the best flavor and texture, wrap cake in plastic and let sit at room temperature at least a day before serving.
Cake can be baked 4 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

SoufflÃ©ed Cheesecake
1 3/4 cups (7 ounces) graham cracker crumbs (store-bought, or make Whole Wheat Graham Crackers)
2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
2 pounds cream cheese (four 8-ounce packages), softenedâabout 70 degrees F
1 cup (8 ounces) fresh goat cheese (not precrumbled), softenedâabout 70 degrees F
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
1/4 teaspoon orange flower water
2 cups (14 ounces) sugar
6 large eggs, straight from the fridge
3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 450 degrees F. This recipe requires an 8-by-3 3/4-inch round pan, whether springform, non-latching with a removable bottom, or a traditional cake pan. With a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom in foil before attaching the sides. With a solid pan, line the bottom with parchment paper. In either case, lightly grease the pan.
Add the crumbs, butter, and salt to the prepared pan, stir with a fork until well combined, and then compress into an even layer.
Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until roughly combined, then increase to medium and beat until smooth, about 5 minutes; halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
Reduce speed to medium-low, add sugar all at once, and mix until well combined. Set a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl, crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through; discard any clots that remain. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.
In a 1-quart stainless steel saucepan, bring the cream to a full boil. Add to batter while mixing on low; this helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing. Use immediately, or refrigerate until neededâup to 1 week (bring to room temperature before baking).
Pour into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the cheesecake puffs 1/2 inch over the rim of the pan and is golden on top, about 20 minutes. If necessary, rotate the baking sheet halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
Turn off the oven and open the door to vent for 10 minutes. Close the door, set oven to 250 degrees F, and continue baking until the outer edges of the cheesecake feel firm and the center registers 145 degrees F on a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes.
Cool cheesecake for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Cool for an hour more, then cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 12 hours.
Loosen the sides of the cheesecake with a thin knife. For a springform pan, simply pop the latch and remove the sides. For a non-latching pan, set on a large can of tomatoes or similarly sized object and use both hands to carefully drop the outer ring. For a solid cake pan, let stand in a few inches of scalding water until the pan feels warm. Drape the cake with plastic wrap and invert onto a large flat plate. Remove the pan or the bottom of a two-piece pan, peel off the parchment, and invert onto a serving plate.
Cut with a long thin knife, pausing to clean the blade under hot running water between slices. Tightly wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep for up to 10 days in the fridge.

Cookie Crumb Cheesecake: Replace the Graham Cracker crumbs with an equal amount of Oreo crumbs or Nutter Butter crumbs.
Fromage: For a truly cheesy cake, reduce the cream cheese to 24 ounces, omit the goat cheese, and divide the remaining 16 ounces between two or more of your favorite soft, rich cheeses. Some of my favorites include Fromage dâAffinois, Saint-Marcellin, BÃ»cheron, mascarpone, and even Saint Agur (a particularly creamy blue). Their flavor will shine through clearly, so choose something you know and love.
Green Tea Cheesecake: The herbal, mossy flavor of Japanese green tea provides a lovely counterpoint to the tangy richness of cream cheese. Simply whisk 2 tablespoons matcha (not bagged or loose green tea) into the sugar and proceed as directed.
Pumpkin Cheesecake: Reduce cream cheese to 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups), replace lemon juice with Â½ ounce (1 tablespoon) dark rum, and increase kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Along with sugar, add 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1Â½ teaspoons ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Omit heavy cream, and replace with 15 ounces (1 2/3 cups) pumpkin puree. If you like, serve with butterscotch sauce and a sprinkling of toasted hazelnut pieces.
Gluten-Free: Prepare crust with the Gluten-Free variation of my Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers (TK LINK TO RECIPE); thanks to the roasted soybean flour in the dough, they bake up with a nutty richness much like classic whole wheat.

Ricotta Cheesecake with Almond Praline
1 cup (150g) plain (all-purpose) flour
1/4 cup (55g) caster (superfine) sugar
100g (7 tablespoons) unsalted butter, chopped
330g (10 1/2 ounces) cream cheese, chopped and softened
500g (2 cups) fresh ricotta
1 1/3 cups (295g) caster (superfine) sugar
1/4 cup (60ml) lemon juice
2 tablespoons finely grated lemon rind
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
5 eggs
3/4 cup (165g) raw caster (superfine) sugar
1/2 cup (40g) flaked (blanched, sliced) almonds, toasted

Preheat oven to 150 degrees C (300 degrees F).
Lightly grease a 22cm round springform cake tin and line the base with non-stick baking paper. Set aside.
To make the base, place the flour, sugar and butter in a food processor and process for 1 minute or until a rough dough forms.
Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture into the base of the prepared tin. Bake for 30â35 minutes or until golden and just cooked. Set aside to cool slightly.
While the base is baking, make the filling. Place the cream cheese, ricotta, sugar, lemon juice, lemon rind and vanilla in a food processor and process until smooth. Place the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture and the eggs to the filling and process to combine.
Lightly re-grease the sides of the cake tin and pour the filling over the base, tapping gently to remove any air bubbles.
Bake for 50 minutesâ1 hour or until light golden and just set. Allow to cool in the closed oven for 50 minutes.
Refrigerate for 1 hour or until chilled.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees C (400 degrees F). Sprinkle the sugar over a large lightly greased baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper. Bake for 12â15 minutes or until melted. Sprinkle with the almonds and allow to set completely on the tray. Crush the praline into small pieces. Sprinkle the cheesecake with the almond praline to serve, pressing gently to secure.

Not-Quite-Bonnie's Rugelach
1 1/4 cups (160 g) all-purpose flour
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon (3/4 tsp)
Scraped seeds of 1/4 vanilla pod
1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp (125 g) unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut roughly into 1-inch/3-cm cubes
4 1/2 oz (125 g) cream cheese, fridge-cold
1/3 cup (40 g) walnut halves
1/2 packed cup plus 1 tbsp (100 g) light brown sugar
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
5 1/4 oz (150 g) store-bought quince paste (membrillo)
1 tsp lemon juice
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/2 tbsp demerara sugar

To make the pastry, place the flour, salt, baking powder, lemon zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse for about 15 seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse for a few seconds more, until the mixture has the texture of fresh breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese and process just until the dough comes together in a ball around the blade; be careful not to overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds, just to bring it together.
Divide the pastry in two, cover each half loosely in plastic wrap, then press to flatten into disks. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
To make the filling, spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool, then chop finely and place in a small bowl with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix together and set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).
Take one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.
Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C.
When ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20â25 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Donât worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
The pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.
These will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Donât keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky.

Soft Gingerbread Tiles with Rum Butter Glaze
6 tbsp (85 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/3 packed cup plus 2 tbsp (90 g) dark brown sugar
1/4 cup (100 g) blackstrap molasses
1 large egg yolk
1 3/4 cups plus 2 tbsp (235 g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for pressing
1 tbsp Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2/3 cup (80 g) confectioners' sugar
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp (15 g) unsalted butter, melted and warm
1 tbsp dark rum (or lemon juice)
1 tsp warm water

Place the butter, sugar and molasses in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed until smooth and incorporated. Add the egg yolk and continue to beat until fully combined.
Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, salt and pepper into a bowl. Turn the speed of the mixer to low, and add the dry ingredients to the butter and molasses. Once the mix comes together, tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead gently. Roll out the dough so that it is about 1/4 inch/ 0.5 cm thick. If the dough is very soft, you will need to chill it.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
Dip the cookie stamps in a small bowl of flour, shake off any excess and then press them firmly into the dough, one at a time, to create a deep imprint. How far you need to press to get an imprint will depend on your stamp; the patterns on some are more deeply cut than others. Bear in mind that the cookies rise a little when cooked, so any soft imprints will disappear. Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly larger than the pattern, cut out the pieces of imprinted gingerbread. Transfer the cookies to the lined baking sheets, spaced about 3/4 inch/2 cm apart. Reroll the dough and continue to stamp and cut cookies until all the dough is used up.
Bake for 9â10 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until firm to the touch. They will continue to firm up as they cool, so donât be tempted to bake them for any longer.
To make the rum butter glaze while the gingerbreads are in the oven, as the glaze needs to be brushed onto the cookies while they are still warm, sift the confectionersâ sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl. Add the melted butter, rum (or lemon juice) and water and mix with a spoon until smooth. The glaze will thicken slightly if it sits around, so stir through a little more warm water if you need toâit should be the consistency of runny honey.
Remove the cookies from the oven, leave them to cool for 5 minutes, then brush or dab the glaze all over with a pastry brush. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Once the dough is made, it can be covered in plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for up to 2 days before baking.
These will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container. The glaze will discolor and crack a little, but this will not affect how they taste.

No-Bake PistachioâWhite Chocolate Cookies
3/4 cup creamy no-stir sunflower seed or almond butter
1 cup white chocolate chips (about 6 ounces), divided
1 cup quick-cooking oats
3/4 cup dried cranberries, coarsely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon chopped, unsalted pistachios (about 2.3 ounces), divided
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil

Heat sunflower seed butter and 3/4 cup chips in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until melted and smooth. Add oats, cranberries, salt, and 1/2 cup pistachios; stir gently to combine.
Spoon mixture by the tablespoonful onto a parchment-lined sheet tray. Gently press balls in the center to flatten. Chill until set, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil and remaining 1/4 chips in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until melted and smooth.
Drizzle cooled cookies with melted chocolate, top with remaining 1 Tbsp. pistachios, and chill until set, about 5 minutes.
Cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill.

Blood Orange and Poppy Polenta Shortbread Cookies
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
2/3 cup polenta (coarse cornmeal)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for hands
1/2 cup granulated sugar
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
Finely grated zest of 2 blood oranges
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons poppy seeds, plus more for sprinkling
1/2 cup blood orange juice
1 cup powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter an 8x8 inch baking pan, preferably metal. Line with parchment paper, creating overhang on 2 sides. Lightly butter parchment. Whisk polenta, salt, and 1 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl to combine. Place granulated sugar and blood orange and lemon zests in a large bowl and rub together with your fingers until mixture is very fragrant and sugar starts to look a little moist, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup butter and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold dough with a rubber spatula a few times to incorporate any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl. The dough will be wet and a bit sticky.
Using floured hands, gently press half of the dough into prepared pan in an even layer. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp. poppy seeds over dough; press gently to adhere. Scatter pieces of remaining dough over and press down into an even layer with floured hands. For a completely flat surface, use the bottom of a straight-sided measuring cup to smooth dough.
Bake shortbread until edges are golden brown and center is light golden, 25â30 minutes. Let cool in pan.
Meanwhile, simmer blood orange juice in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until reduced to 2 Tbsp., 10â12 minutes. Pour into a small bowl and let cool.
Carefully slide a small knife or offset spatula along sides of pan not lined with parchment paper, then use edges of paper to lift out shortbread onto a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, slice into quarters in one direction, then into eighths in the other direction (for larger bars, just cut in half first). Puzzle shortbread bars back into pan the same way they came out; set aside.
Add powdered sugar to bowl with reduced juice and whisk until smooth. The glaze should fall off the end of the whisk in a thick, glossy, smooth ribbon. If glaze is not pourable and gets stuck in the whisk, add in water a Â½-teaspoonful at a time until you get the right consistency. Drizzle glaze over shortbread in pan and use an offset spatula to smooth all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with more poppy seeds and let shortbread sit until glaze is set, at least 1 hour.
Just before serving, retrace cuts with a sharp knife and remove bars from pan.
Shortbread can be baked 3 days ahead. Once glaze is set, cover tightly and store at room temperature.

Hazelnut Lace Sandwich Cookies
1/2 cup blanched hazelnuts
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/3 cup blueberry jam, strained
Finely grated zest of 1 lime

Pulse hazelnuts, flour, and salt in a food processor until nuts are finely ground; set aside.
Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until butter foams, then browns, about 5 minutes. Let cool about 5 minutes, then add granulated sugar, cream, maple syrup, vanilla, and 1 Tbsp. water and stir to incorporate. Return saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil; cook, without stirring, 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir in hazelnut mixture. Scrape batter into a medium heatproof bowl and let cool, stirring occasionally to reincorporate the butter.
Meanwhile, place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325 degrees F.
Scoop out rounded teaspoonfuls of batter and roll between the palms of your hands into smooth balls. Place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets at least 3 inch apart. Because these cookies spread so much during baking, give each ball plenty of space. You should be able to fit 8 per sheet and will need to bake in 2 batches for a total of 32 cookies.
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until they spread into thin lacy disks and are deep golden brown around the edges, 10â14 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Repeat with remaining batter, using fresh parchment paper on baking sheets.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter in a medium bowl until light, about 1 minute. Add powdered sugar and beat until pale, about 30 seconds. Add jam about 1 tablespoonful at a time, beating until smooth after each addition, then beat in lime zest.
Carefully remove cooled cookies from parchment. Using a small offset spatula, spread 1â2 tsp. filling across flat sides of half of cookies. Top with remaining cookies to create sandwiches.
Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature, separated by layers of parchment paper to prevent sticking.

SoufflÃ©ed Cheesecake
1 3/4 cups (7 ounces) graham cracker crumbs (store-bought, or make Whole Wheat Graham Crackers)
2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
2 pounds cream cheese (four 8-ounce packages), softenedâabout 70 degrees F
1 cup (8 ounces) fresh goat cheese (not precrumbled), softenedâabout 70 degrees F
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
1/4 teaspoon orange flower water
2 cups (14 ounces) sugar
6 large eggs, straight from the fridge
3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 450 degrees F. This recipe requires an 8-by-3 3/4-inch round pan, whether springform, non-latching with a removable bottom, or a traditional cake pan. With a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom in foil before attaching the sides. With a solid pan, line the bottom with parchment paper. In either case, lightly grease the pan.
Add the crumbs, butter, and salt to the prepared pan, stir with a fork until well combined, and then compress into an even layer.
Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until roughly combined, then increase to medium and beat until smooth, about 5 minutes; halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
Reduce speed to medium-low, add sugar all at once, and mix until well combined. Set a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl, crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through; discard any clots that remain. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.
In a 1-quart stainless steel saucepan, bring the cream to a full boil. Add to batter while mixing on low; this helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing. Use immediately, or refrigerate until neededâup to 1 week (bring to room temperature before baking).
Pour into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the cheesecake puffs 1/2 inch over the rim of the pan and is golden on top, about 20 minutes. If necessary, rotate the baking sheet halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
Turn off the oven and open the door to vent for 10 minutes. Close the door, set oven to 250 degrees F, and continue baking until the outer edges of the cheesecake feel firm and the center registers 145 degrees F on a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes.
Cool cheesecake for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Cool for an hour more, then cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 12 hours.
Loosen the sides of the cheesecake with a thin knife. For a springform pan, simply pop the latch and remove the sides. For a non-latching pan, set on a large can of tomatoes or similarly sized object and use both hands to carefully drop the outer ring. For a solid cake pan, let stand in a few inches of scalding water until the pan feels warm. Drape the cake with plastic wrap and invert onto a large flat plate. Remove the pan or the bottom of a two-piece pan, peel off the parchment, and invert onto a serving plate.
Cut with a long thin knife, pausing to clean the blade under hot running water between slices. Tightly wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep for up to 10 days in the fridge.

Cookie Crumb Cheesecake: Replace the Graham Cracker crumbs with an equal amount of Oreo crumbs or Nutter Butter crumbs.
Fromage: For a truly cheesy cake, reduce the cream cheese to 24 ounces, omit the goat cheese, and divide the remaining 16 ounces between two or more of your favorite soft, rich cheeses. Some of my favorites include Fromage dâAffinois, Saint-Marcellin, BÃ»cheron, mascarpone, and even Saint Agur (a particularly creamy blue). Their flavor will shine through clearly, so choose something you know and love.
Green Tea Cheesecake: The herbal, mossy flavor of Japanese green tea provides a lovely counterpoint to the tangy richness of cream cheese. Simply whisk 2 tablespoons matcha (not bagged or loose green tea) into the sugar and proceed as directed.
Pumpkin Cheesecake: Reduce cream cheese to 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups), replace lemon juice with Â½ ounce (1 tablespoon) dark rum, and increase kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Along with sugar, add 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1Â½ teaspoons ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Omit heavy cream, and replace with 15 ounces (1 2/3 cups) pumpkin puree. If you like, serve with butterscotch sauce and a sprinkling of toasted hazelnut pieces.
Gluten-Free: Prepare crust with the Gluten-Free variation of my Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers (TK LINK TO RECIPE); thanks to the roasted soybean flour in the dough, they bake up with a nutty richness much like classic whole wheat.

Caramel Apple Drip Cake with Candied Walnuts
1 cup raw walnuts
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 medium apples (such as Gala, Honeycrisp, or Pink Lady), peeled, coarsely grated
1 cup buttermilk, room temperature
4 large eggs, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup granulated sugar, divided
2 cups raw walnut halves
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch of kosher salt
Classic Cream Cheese Frosting
2 (8 inch) round cake pans

Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Spread walnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden brown and aromatic, 5â8 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, lightly coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg in a medium bowl.
Pulse walnuts and 1/2 cup dry ingredients in a food processor until walnuts are chopped into a fine flour. Transfer chopped walnuts to bowl with remaining dry ingredients. Mix apples and buttermilk in another medium bowl.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until pale and thick, about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium-low and gradually stream in oil. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with apple mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Divide batter between prepared pans; smooth top.
Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40â45 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes. Run a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool completely.
Spread granulated sugar in a thin layer in the center of a large dry skillet. Cook over medium heat, mostly undisturbed (it's okay to swirl pan gently to get sugar to melt evenly), until sugar is melted, about 10 minutes. Quickly stir in walnuts and cook, stirring, until coated and melted sugar is chestnut brown, about 1 minute more. Scrape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread out to cool, separating walnut halves into individual pieces. Transfer half of nuts to a food processor and coarsely chop.
Bring granulated sugar, corn syrup, and 2 Tbsp. water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Continue to cook, without stirring, until medium amber in color, about 6 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat or warm in microwave 45 seconds.
Remove saucepan with sugar from heat and carefully whisk in cream, stirring from the center outward, until well combined. Stir in butter. Add vanilla and salt and stir to combine. Transfer caramel to a heatproof container and let cool until thickened.
Spread 1 Tbsp. frosting in the center of a platter. Place 1 cake, domed side down, on platter. Spread 1 1/4 cups frosting evenly over top. Top with 1 cup chopped candied walnuts, reserving whole candied walnuts. Place remaining cake, domed side down, on top. Spread top and sides with 2 cups frosting. Chill 30 minutes to let frosting set.
Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Chill at least 30 minutes or up to overnight to let frosting set.
Place a spoonful of caramel sauce on top of cake near one edge. Using the bottom of the spoon, spread it out, then very gently press a little sauce over the edge. Move spoon around perimeter of cake slightly and repeat to create additional drips, rotating cake as you work and spreading excess sauce across top of cake. When entire cake is covered in drips, add remaining sauce to fully cover top.
Chill at least 30 minutes to let glaze set. Decorate top and sides of cake with remaining whole walnuts and serve.
Cake can be made 3 days ahead; wrap tightly in plastic and chill, or freeze up to 2 weeks. Caramel can be made up to 2 weeks ahead; cover and chill.

Blood Orange and Poppy Polenta Shortbread Cookies
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
2/3 cup polenta (coarse cornmeal)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for hands
1/2 cup granulated sugar
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
Finely grated zest of 2 blood oranges
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons poppy seeds, plus more for sprinkling
1/2 cup blood orange juice
1 cup powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter an 8x8 inch baking pan, preferably metal. Line with parchment paper, creating overhang on 2 sides. Lightly butter parchment. Whisk polenta, salt, and 1 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl to combine. Place granulated sugar and blood orange and lemon zests in a large bowl and rub together with your fingers until mixture is very fragrant and sugar starts to look a little moist, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup butter and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold dough with a rubber spatula a few times to incorporate any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl. The dough will be wet and a bit sticky.
Using floured hands, gently press half of the dough into prepared pan in an even layer. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp. poppy seeds over dough; press gently to adhere. Scatter pieces of remaining dough over and press down into an even layer with floured hands. For a completely flat surface, use the bottom of a straight-sided measuring cup to smooth dough.
Bake shortbread until edges are golden brown and center is light golden, 25â30 minutes. Let cool in pan.
Meanwhile, simmer blood orange juice in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until reduced to 2 Tbsp., 10â12 minutes. Pour into a small bowl and let cool.
Carefully slide a small knife or offset spatula along sides of pan not lined with parchment paper, then use edges of paper to lift out shortbread onto a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, slice into quarters in one direction, then into eighths in the other direction (for larger bars, just cut in half first). Puzzle shortbread bars back into pan the same way they came out; set aside.
Add powdered sugar to bowl with reduced juice and whisk until smooth. The glaze should fall off the end of the whisk in a thick, glossy, smooth ribbon. If glaze is not pourable and gets stuck in the whisk, add in water a Â½-teaspoonful at a time until you get the right consistency. Drizzle glaze over shortbread in pan and use an offset spatula to smooth all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with more poppy seeds and let shortbread sit until glaze is set, at least 1 hour.
Just before serving, retrace cuts with a sharp knife and remove bars from pan.
Shortbread can be baked 3 days ahead. Once glaze is set, cover tightly and store at room temperature.

Not-Quite-Bonnie's Rugelach
1 1/4 cups (160 g) all-purpose flour
1/8 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon (3/4 tsp)
Scraped seeds of 1/4 vanilla pod
1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp (125 g) unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut roughly into 1-inch/3-cm cubes
4 1/2 oz (125 g) cream cheese, fridge-cold
1/3 cup (40 g) walnut halves
1/2 packed cup plus 1 tbsp (100 g) light brown sugar
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
5 1/4 oz (150 g) store-bought quince paste (membrillo)
1 tsp lemon juice
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/2 tbsp demerara sugar

To make the pastry, place the flour, salt, baking powder, lemon zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse for about 15 seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse for a few seconds more, until the mixture has the texture of fresh breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese and process just until the dough comes together in a ball around the blade; be careful not to overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds, just to bring it together.
Divide the pastry in two, cover each half loosely in plastic wrap, then press to flatten into disks. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
To make the filling, spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool, then chop finely and place in a small bowl with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix together and set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).
Take one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.
Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C.
When ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20â25 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Donât worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
The pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.
These will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Donât keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky.

Ricotta Cheesecake with Almond Praline
1 cup (150g) plain (all-purpose) flour
1/4 cup (55g) caster (superfine) sugar
100g (7 tablespoons) unsalted butter, chopped
330g (10 1/2 ounces) cream cheese, chopped and softened
500g (2 cups) fresh ricotta
1 1/3 cups (295g) caster (superfine) sugar
1/4 cup (60ml) lemon juice
2 tablespoons finely grated lemon rind
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
5 eggs
3/4 cup (165g) raw caster (superfine) sugar
1/2 cup (40g) flaked (blanched, sliced) almonds, toasted

Preheat oven to 150 degrees C (300 degrees F).
Lightly grease a 22cm round springform cake tin and line the base with non-stick baking paper. Set aside.
To make the base, place the flour, sugar and butter in a food processor and process for 1 minute or until a rough dough forms.
Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture into the base of the prepared tin. Bake for 30â35 minutes or until golden and just cooked. Set aside to cool slightly.
While the base is baking, make the filling. Place the cream cheese, ricotta, sugar, lemon juice, lemon rind and vanilla in a food processor and process until smooth. Place the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture and the eggs to the filling and process to combine.
Lightly re-grease the sides of the cake tin and pour the filling over the base, tapping gently to remove any air bubbles.
Bake for 50 minutesâ1 hour or until light golden and just set. Allow to cool in the closed oven for 50 minutes.
Refrigerate for 1 hour or until chilled.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees C (400 degrees F). Sprinkle the sugar over a large lightly greased baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper. Bake for 12â15 minutes or until melted. Sprinkle with the almonds and allow to set completely on the tray. Crush the praline into small pieces. Sprinkle the cheesecake with the almond praline to serve, pressing gently to secure.

3/4 cup dried cranberries, coarsely chopped
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon chopped, unsalted pistachios (about 2.3 ounces), divided
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil

Heat sunflower seed butter and 3/4 cup chips in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until melted and smooth. Add oats, cranberries, salt, and 1/2 cup pistachios; stir gently to combine.
Spoon mixture by the tablespoonful onto a parchment-lined sheet tray. Gently press balls in the center to flatten. Chill until set, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil and remaining 1/4 chips in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until melted and smooth.
Drizzle cooled cookies with melted chocolate, top with remaining 1 Tbsp. pistachios, and chill until set, about 5 minutes.
Cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill.

Spiced and Glazed Molasses Cookies
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons finely ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling
1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 large egg, room temperature
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon mild-flavored (light) molasses
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon (or more) milk
Raw sugar (for sprinkling)

Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and 1 1/2 tsp. pepper in a medium bowl to combine.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed,beat brown sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and beat to incorporate. Add 1/3 cup molasses and mix just to combine. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients; beat just until incorporated. Pat dough together and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Scoop out level tablespoonfuls of dough and roll between the palms of your hands into smooth balls. Place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2 inch apart (you should be able to fit about 12 on each sheet).
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until just firm around the edges, 9â12 minutes (if you like chewier cookies, bake less, and if a crispier cookie is your thing, bake a little longer). Let cookies cool about 5 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.
Repeat with remaining dough, using fresh parchment paper on baking sheets.
Whisk powdered sugar, milk, and remaining 1 Tbsp. molasses in a medium bowl until smooth. The glaze should be very thick and glossy but still pourable. If needed, add more milk or water 1/2-teaspoonful at a time until you get to the right consistency. Drizzle glaze over cookies and sprinkle with raw sugar and more pepper.
Cookies can be baked and glazed 2 days ahead. Once glaze is set, store airtight at room temperature, or freeze unglazed cookies up to 1 month in resealable plastic bags.

Frosted Malt-Chocolate Cookies
10 ounces semisweet chocolate wafers (disks, pistoles, fÃ¨ves; about 2 cups), divided
3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons malted milk powder
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for parchment paper
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
2/3 cup plus 1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
Flaky sea salt
A 1 1/2-inch-diameter cookie cutter

Pulse 6 oz. chocolate wafers in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl.
Pulse brown sugar, cocoa powder, malted milk powder, baking powder, kosher salt, and 2 cups flour in food processor several times to combine. Add butter and pulse until pieces are broken up into bits no larger than a pea. Add to bowl with chocolate and toss to combine.
Stir vanilla and 2/3 cup cream in a measuring glass to combine, then slowly drizzle over chocolate mixture, mixing with a fork all the while. Mixture will look dry once youâve added all the cream. Knead dough a few times in the bowl (it will not come together and will look crumbly), then transfer to a large piece of plastic wrap. Bring the edges of plastic up and over dough and press down to incorporate floury parts, then wrap tightly. Use the heel of your hand to press down firmly on the dough, forcing it to tightly fill out the plastic. This will help the dough adhere into a single mass and help the flour hydrate. Chill dough until firm, at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out dough between 2 sheets of floured parchment paper to 3/4 inch thick (you might not have to roll it very much). Punch out rounds with cookie cutter as close together as possible. Transfer biscuits to a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze 10 minutes.
Bake biscuits, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until firm to the touch around the edges, 13â18 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet.
Meanwhile, heat corn syrup, remaining 4 oz. chocolate, and remaining 1/2 cup cream in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (bowl should not be touching the water), stirring often, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth. Set bowl with frosting into a large bowl of ice water and let cool, stirring occasionally, until thickened but still pourable and shiny. Spoon a scant tablespoonful of frosting onto each biscuit; sprinkle with sea salt.
Dough can be made 1 day ahead; keep chilled. Biscuits (without frosting) can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.

Simple Vanilla Jam Drops
1 x quantity unrolled Vanilla Snap Cookie dough
1/2 cup (160g) raspberry jam

Place the butter, sugar and vanilla in a food processor and process until smooth.
Add the flour, egg and extra egg yolk and process until a smooth dough forms.
Preheat oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F). Roll tablespoons of the dough into balls and place on lightly greased baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper. Flatten slightly and, using your fingertip, make an indent in each round. Fill each indent with 1/4 teaspoon of the jam. Bake for 12â14 minutes or until golden. Allow to cool on trays for 10 minutes before transferring onto wire racks to cool completely.

Gingerbread Brownies
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
2 1/4 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
4 large eggs
3 tablespoons molasses (not robust/blackstrap)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9x9 inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Line pan with 2 overlapping layers of parchment, leaving a 2 inch overhang on all sides. Coat parchment with nonstick spray.
Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl. Melt butter in a medium heatproof bowl in the microwave or in a medium pot over medium heat. Immediately add hot butter to sugar mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously with spoon or spatula after each addition, until batter is thick, shiny, and smooth. Stir in molasses and vanilla. Using a sifter or fine-mesh sieve, sift in flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and cloves. Stir until well incorporated, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes.
Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Bake brownie until top is firm to the touch, edges are set, center is moist but not uncooked, and a tester or paring knife inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs (not runny batter) attached, 25â25 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack and let brownie cool completely in pan. Using parchment overhang, lift brownie out of pan and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 16 squares.

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
4 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream
Pinch of kosher salt
1 tablespoons brandy (optional)
A 9 inch round cake pan; a cake board

Spray a large bowl (at least 12-cup capacity; the stainless steel bowl of a stand mixer is perfect) with nonstick spray, then line with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang.
Heat corn syrup, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low until sugar is melted. Increase heat to medium and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 240 degrees F, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed (or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Reduce mixer speed to low and carefully add sugar syrup to egg whites in a slow and steady stream. Increase speed to high and beat until mixture is light, glossy, and fluffy, 6â8 minutes.
Using electric mixer on high speed, beat cream cheese in another large bowl until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add heavy cream, milk, vanilla, and salt and beat until smooth.
Whisk oneâthird of meringue into cream cheese mixture to lighten. Gently fold remaining meringue into cream cheese mixture. Fold in apricots, cherries, and pistachios.
Pour mixture into prepared bowl, smooth top, then bring plastic up and over bombe, pressing against bottom of bowl to compact. Freeze until hard, at least 12 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat cake pan with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.
Heat butter and chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring, until chocolate is melted and smooth.
Using electric mixer on medium speed, beat eggs and sugar in another large bowl until pale and tripled in volume, 10â12 minutes.
Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, orange zest, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk dry ingredients into chocolate mixture until well combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold about one-third of egg mixture into chocolate mixture to lighten, then fold chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture until combined.
Pour batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Bake cake until center is set and sides are beginning to brown, 45â50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool completely in pan (cake will sink a little in the center as it cools).
Trim cake board to fit inside bowl with mousse (slightly smaller than diameter of bowl). Remove cake from pan and trim to flatten top, then trim to size of cake board. Place cake on board, then place board on a wire rack set on a sheet tray.
Rub bowl with a very hot, wet towel to defrost slightly; remove plastic wrap from top of bowl. Invert bowl upside down on top of cake. Using plastic, gently pull so mousse comes free; adjust to center mousse on cake, if needed. Peel off plastic.
Place chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat cream in a small pot over medium until hot but not boiling. Pour over chocolate, let sit 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Add salt and brandy (if using) and stir to combine.
Spoon glaze over bombe, letting it drip over sides to coat thoroughly.
Transfer bombe to a platter. Cut into wedges with a hot dry knife (run knife under hot water and wipe dry between slices).
Mousse bombe can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen. Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers
3/4 cup (5 1/2 ounces) sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup (3 ounces) golden syrup, such as Lyleâs, sorghum, unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap), or honey
1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, solid but creamyâabout 70 degrees F
2 1/2 cups (12 ounces) whole wheat flour (not stone-ground or white whole wheat), plus more for dusting

Combine sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, golden syrup, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.
Scrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.
For grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.
Bake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months.
Chocolate: My mom used to sandwich chocolate graham crackers with peanut butter for an after-school snack, a combo I re-create by reducing the whole wheat flour to 10 ounces (21/4 cups), sifted with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) natural or Dutch-process cocoa powder. To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.
Cinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friendâs house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to Â½ teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.
Coconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamyâabout 70 degrees F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.
Gingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.
Graham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350 degrees F until firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature for immediate use in your favorite recipe, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
Gluten-Free: Replace the whole wheat flour with 6 ounces (11/4 cups) white rice flour, 4 ounces (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) oat flour, and 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) kinako.

1 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1/4 cup water
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
6 ounces cream cheese
1/4 pound each brown, white, black, and orange fondant
Fondant roller
Piping gel
144 pieces of candy corn

To make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350ËF, and line two cupcake pans with twelve paper baking cups each. Sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
Add each egg slowly, one at a time, mixing after each addition.
Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, followed by one third of the water. Mix slowly. Then add another third of the flour mixture, followed by another third of the water. Mix slowly again. Finally, add the last third of the flour mixture and the last third of the water. Mix until all the ingredients are incorporated.
Scrape down the bowl, and add the cranberries. Fold in using a spatula until the cranberries are scattered throughout the batter.
Using a standard-size ice cream scoop, fill each baking cup so that it is two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Let the cupcakes cool and then frost with Georgetown Cupcake's signature swirl (see note)
In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer, mix all the ingredients for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, until frosting is light and airy. Frost each cupcake with a thick layer of the frosting using an offset spatula.
Roll out a small ball of brown fondant, approximately the size of a golf ball, to form the body of your turkey. Then roll out a ball of brown fondant, approximately half the size of the first ball, to form the head of your turkey. Attach the head to the body using piping gel or water.
Roll out two small balls of white fondant, each approximately the size of a pea, to form the eyeballs of your turkey.
Roll out two small balls of black fondant, each approximately the size of half a pea, to form the pupils of your turkeyâs eyes. Using piping gel or water, attach the pupils to the eyeballs, and the eyeballs to the turkeyâs head.
Roll out a small piece of orange fondant, and shape it into a crescent to form the turkeyâs beak. Attach it to the turkeyâs head using piping gel or water.
Roll out four small pieces of brown fondant and shape them into rounded teardrops to form feathers.
Let the fondant turkey and feathers set for 5 to 10 minutes, and then place the turkey on top of a cupcake, with the feathers placed behind.
Line up six pieces of candy corn, pointed side down on the brown fondant feathers behind the turkeyâs body to form another layer of feathers.

Nutter ButterÂ® Cookies
2 cups (9 ounces) all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting
6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, creamy and softâabout 68 degrees F
1/3 cup (3 ounces) creamy peanut butter, such as Skippy
1 cup (7 ounces) sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
2 large egg whites (1/4 cup (2 1/4 ounces))
6 tablespoons | 3 ounces unsalted butter, creamy and softâabout 68 degrees F
1/3 cup | 3 ounces creamy peanut butter, such as Skippy
1 tablespoon | 3/4 ounce honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)
1 cup | 4 ounces organic powdered sugar, sifted

Sift flour (if using a cup measure, spoon into the cup and level with a knife before sifting).
Combine butter, peanut butter, sugar, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Beat the whites with a fork until foamy and thin, then add to the butter and sugar in four additions, letting each incorporate before adding the next. Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Sprinkle in the flour, and mix to form a soft dough.
Knead against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball, divide in half, and flatten into discs. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. On a flour-dusted surface, roll the dough until 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle with flour, flip, sprinkle again, and roll just shy of 1/8 inch. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen. Cut into  inchpeanuts inch with a 3-inch bikini cookie cutter (see Cooks' Note) or into simple 2 1/4-inch rounds and arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 1/4 inch between them. If you like, gently score the cutouts with a bench scraper to make a diamond pattern. Gather scraps, re-roll, and cut as before. The remaining scraps can also be baked, to grind for crumbs.
Bake until wafers are firm and dry, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on the baking sheet. Use immediately, or transfer to an airtight container and store for up to a week at room temperature or a month in the fridge.
Combine butter, peanut butter, honey, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then sprinkle in the powdered sugar a little at a time. Once fully incorporated, increase to medium and beat until the creme is soft and light, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater halfway through. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.
Pipe 1/4 ounce (2 teaspoons) creme into the center of half of the rounds or 1/8 ounce (1 teaspoon) into each  inchlobe inch of a peanut. Sandwich with the remaining wafers; there are extras to account for breakage. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until the filling has set, about 15 minutes. Store up to 1 week at room temperature or up to a month in the fridge; serve at room temperature.
Cookie Crumbs: Grind broken wafers and scraps in a food processor until fine; freeze in a quart zip-top bag for up to 6 months. Use to replace the graham cracker crumbs in SoufflÃ©ed Cheesecake or bake into a crumb crust.
Vegan: Replace the butter in the dough and filling with an equal amount of refined coconut oil and omit the egg whites in the dough. Refrigerate for 15 minutes before rolling the dough.
Gluten-Free: Replace the all-purpose flour with 4 ounces (1 1/4 cups) oat flour, 3 ounces (2/3 cup) white rice flour, and 2 ounces (1/2 cup) coconut flour.

Soft Gingerbread Tiles with Rum Butter Glaze
6 tbsp (85 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/3 packed cup plus 2 tbsp (90 g) dark brown sugar
1/4 cup (100 g) blackstrap molasses
1 large egg yolk
1 3/4 cups plus 2 tbsp (235 g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for pressing
1 tbsp Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2/3 cup (80 g) confectioners' sugar
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp (15 g) unsalted butter, melted and warm
1 tbsp dark rum (or lemon juice)
1 tsp warm water

Place the butter, sugar and molasses in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed until smooth and incorporated. Add the egg yolk and continue to beat until fully combined.
Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, salt and pepper into a bowl. Turn the speed of the mixer to low, and add the dry ingredients to the butter and molasses. Once the mix comes together, tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead gently. Roll out the dough so that it is about 1/4 inch/ 0.5 cm thick. If the dough is very soft, you will need to chill it.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
Dip the cookie stamps in a small bowl of flour, shake off any excess and then press them firmly into the dough, one at a time, to create a deep imprint. How far you need to press to get an imprint will depend on your stamp; the patterns on some are more deeply cut than others. Bear in mind that the cookies rise a little when cooked, so any soft imprints will disappear. Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly larger than the pattern, cut out the pieces of imprinted gingerbread. Transfer the cookies to the lined baking sheets, spaced about 3/4 inch/2 cm apart. Reroll the dough and continue to stamp and cut cookies until all the dough is used up.
Bake for 9â10 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until firm to the touch. They will continue to firm up as they cool, so donât be tempted to bake them for any longer.
To make the rum butter glaze while the gingerbreads are in the oven, as the glaze needs to be brushed onto the cookies while they are still warm, sift the confectionersâ sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl. Add the melted butter, rum (or lemon juice) and water and mix with a spoon until smooth. The glaze will thicken slightly if it sits around, so stir through a little more warm water if you need toâit should be the consistency of runny honey.
Remove the cookies from the oven, leave them to cool for 5 minutes, then brush or dab the glaze all over with a pastry brush. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Once the dough is made, it can be covered in plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for up to 2 days before baking.
These will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container. The glaze will discolor and crack a little, but this will not affect how they taste.

Chocolate and Pumpkin Zebra Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for pan
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin purÃ©e
1 cup whole milk, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups sugar
4 large eggs, room temperature
Orange food coloring (optional)
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
Black gel food coloring (optional)
24 ounces high-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped
3 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Black gel food coloring (optional)
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons corn syrup
2 (9 inch) round cake pans; a candy thermometer; plastic spider rings (optional)

Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour cake pans. Whisk cinnamon, salt, baking powder, baking soda, allspice, ginger, cloves, and remaining 2 1/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Mix pumpkin purÃ©e, milk, and vanilla in another medium bowl.
Cream sugar and remaining 1 cup butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until pale and fluffy, 3â4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with pumpkin mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
Transfer 6 cups batter to a large bowl. Whisk in orange food coloring, if using, a few drops at a time until desired color is achieved.
Add cocoa powder to remaining 3 cups batter and beat with stand mixer on medium-low speed until smooth. Add black gel food coloring, if using, a few drops at a time, until desired color is achieved.
Spoon 1 cup pumpkin batter into center of each prepared pan. Spoon 1/2 cup chocolate batter directly on top of pumpkin batter. Repeat 2 times with each batter, spooning batter into centers of pans and occasionally tapping pan firmly on work surface to ensure even distribution. Divide remaining chocolate batter into centers of both pans. The batter will look slightly domed at this point; carefully smooth with an offset spatula, being careful not to disturb the layers too much.
Bake cakes until centers spring back when lightly pressed, 55â60 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool.
Place chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium. Bring to a low simmer, then immediately pour over chocolate. Let sit, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Add vanilla and whisk until smooth. Add black gel food coloring, if using, to achieve a scary black frosting. Let ganache cool at room temperature until thick, about 30 minutes.
Place 2 wooden-handled spoons or spatulas horizontally about 5 inch apart over a large bowl. Prepare an ice bath in a medium bowl.
Heat sugar, corn syrup, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan fitted with candy thermometer over medium, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium heat, without stirring, brushing any sugar crystals down side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Cook until thermometer registers 300 degrees F. Immediately dip bottom of pan in ice bath, stirring with a fork. The sugar is ready once it thickens to the consistency of honey but still flows in a steady stream. Remove pan from ice bath and dip fork in hot sugar. Raise fork about 10 inch above the wooden spatulas and quickly move the fork back and forth, making thin threads of sugar. Repeat, dipping fork back into hot sugar and layering the strands. Form enough strands to create a loose mass resembling a spider web.
Spread 1 Tbsp. ganache in the center of a platter. Place 1 cake layer in the center. Evenly spread 1 1/2 cups ganache on top of cake with an offset spatula, pressing outward toward edges. Carefully place second cake layer, top side down, over, gently pressing down to secure. Evenly spread remaining ganache over top and sides. Chill at least 15 minutes to let ganache set.
When ready to serve, top with spun sugar spider web and plastic spider rings, if using.

Orange Cranberry Cupcakes
1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
2/3 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons lightly packed finely grated orange zest (from 2 large oranges)
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, slightly softened
1 cup sugar
1 large egg
2 large egg whites
1 cup fresh or unthawed frozen cranberries
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened
1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
3 cups confectionersâ sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon whole milk
1 tablespoon lightly packed finely grated orange zest (from 1 large orange)
1 tablespoon fresh orange juice
1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 12-cup cupcake pan with paper liners.
In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and orange zest over low heat until hot (but not boiling); cool to lukewarm, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the vanilla.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low, add the egg and egg whites one at a time, and beat until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add half the flour mixture, then the milk mixture, then the remaining flour mixture, beating until just blended after each addition. In a small bowl, toss the cranberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the cranberries into the batter.
Divide the batter evenly among the liners and bake until the tops are just dry to the touch (some may be slightly golden on the sides before this happens) and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 17 to 19 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting with orange frosting.
Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper cut to fit, and butter the parchment. Flour the pans, coating the bottom and sides of each pan, then tap out the excess flour. Divide the batter between the two pans and bake until the tops are dry to the touch, the sides of the cake start to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (for generally the same amount of time as in the cupcake recipe). Let cool on a wire rack, then remove each cake from its pan, discard the parchment paper, and set one cake layer on a cake round, frosting turntable, or the final serving platter. Frost the top of that cake layer with the frosting, stack the second layer on top, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, gradually add the confectionersâ sugar, and beat until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium, add the milk, orange zest and juice, and vanilla and beat until fully blended, 1 to 2 minutes, making sure not to incorporate too much air into the frosting.

Ricotta Pie with Amarena Cherries
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, plus more for pan
1 cup slivered almonds
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 large egg yolks
12 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1 1/2 cups whole-milk fresh ricotta
3/4 cup sour cream
2 large egg yolks
1 large egg
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon almond extract
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
Amarena or Italian maraschino cherries (for serving)
A 9-inch-diameter springform pan

Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Generously butter pan and set aside. Pulse almonds, flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until almonds are finely ground and mixture is combined. Add egg yolks and pulse to incorporate. Add 3 Tbsp. butter to mixture and pulse until dough is the consistency of wet sand.
Press crust into the bottom and 3/4 inch up the sides of prepared pan using a straight-sided measuring cup. Chill until firm, about 10 minutes.
Bake crust until evenly golden brown and set, 12â14 minutes. (If it slumps during cooking, you can always press it back into place with the measuring cup while itâs still warm.) Transfer pan to a wire rack and let crust cool.
Keep oven at 325 degrees F. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat cream cheese in a medium bowl until no lumps remain, about 1 minute. Add ricotta and sour cream and beat until well incorporated. Add egg yolks and egg one at a time, beating well between each addition. With the motor running, gradually add sugar and salt and beat until filling is creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add almond extract, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and orange zest and mix just to incorporate.
Set pan with prepared crust on a large sheet of foil and fold up foil tightly around sides of pan (you can turn 2 small sheets of foil into 1 large sheet by folding their edges together several times, then opening up like a book). Repeat with several more pieces of foil to create a waterproof seal around the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Set inside a large roasting pan or baking dish and pour filling into crust (it will go above the crust).
Set roasting pan on oven rack and carefully pour in very hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake ricotta pie until the top is set and dry to touch but the filling still wobbles underneath (it will firm as it cools), 65â75 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until cool and firm, 3â4 hours.
Slice ricotta pie and serve topped with amarena cherries.
Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature. Ricotta pie can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.

Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes
1 box (18.25 ounces) French vanilla or yellow cake mix
1 cup canned pumpkin
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Follow the box instructions, putting all the ingredients in a large bowl and using the buttermilk in place of the water specified, using the amount of vegetable oil that is called for, and adding the eggs. Beat with an electric mixer until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to high and beat until thick, 2 minutes longer.
Spoon half the batter into a ziplock bag. Snip 1/4 inch corner from the bag and fill the paper liners two-thirds full. Repeat with the remaining batter. Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the baking pans, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool completely.

Peanut Butter and Sour Cherry Cheesecake
Butter, for greasing
75g (about 1/2 cup) dried sour cherries, plus extra for decorating
1 tbsp caster (superfine) sugar
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
1 tbsp kirsch (optional)
175g digestive biscuits
25g (about 2 tbsp) salted peanuts, plus extra for decorating
75g (5 1/4 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
400g (about 1 3/4 [8oz] packages) full-fat cream cheese
150g (3/4 cup) caster (superfine) sugar
2 egg yolks
250g (1 cup) heavy cream
5 leaves gelatin
150g (1/2 cup) smooth peanut butter
75g (2.6 ounces) dark chocolate, chopped
1 tbsp golden syrup
100ml (about 1/2 cup) double cream
A 20cm (8-inch) round springform tin

Grease a 20cm (8-inch) springform tin and line with baking parchment.
Put the dried sour cherries into a small saucepan with the sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of water. If you are using kirsch, add this now. Bring to the boil and leave to simmer for 4â5 minutes. The cherries should soften and absorb some of the liquid. Set the pan to one side to cool.
To make the biscuit base, blitz the digestive biscuits and peanuts in a food processor until they resemble very fine crumbs. Pour the melted butter into the crumbs and blitz again until all the biscuit crumbs are coated in butter. Alternatively, finely chop the peanuts and place into a plastic bag with the biscuits, use a rolling pin to crush them to a fine powder, then put into a bowl and stir in the butter. Tip the crumbs into the base of the prepared tin, then press them down firmly with the back of a teaspoon to make sure they stick together, then chill for at least 30 minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, caster sugar and egg yolks until smooth. Stir in the cream until you get a thick but not stiff consistency.
Soak the gelatin leaves in cold water and allow to soften completely. This will take around five minutes. Melt the smooth peanut butter in the microwave in a medium bowl for about 30 seconds until it is even smoother. Squeeze the gelatin leaves to remove any excess water, then stir into the warm peanut butter until completely dissolved.
Spoon a few tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into the peanut butter and mix well, before pouring all of the peanut butter mixture into the remaining cream cheese and stirring until completely smooth.
Drain the cherries then add half to the cream cheese mixture and stir in. Spread onto the prepared biscuit base and use a spatula to smooth the top. Leave to set in the refrigerator, preferably overnight, but for at least four hours.
When the cheesecake feels firm enough to hold a layer of chocolate (usually after around two hours of chilling), make the chocolate topping. Place the chocolate, golden syrup and cream into a small bowl. Microwave on high for around one minute, removing from the microwave and stirring well every 15 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and no lumps of chocolate remain. Pour over the cheesecake, tilting the tin until the whole top is covered. Decorate with the remaining sour cherries and peanuts. Chill for two hours before serving.

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup buttermilk
1 egg
1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 apples, chopped
2 cups vegetable oil, for frying
Cinnamon and sugar, for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two standard cupcake tins with 15 paper liners.
Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the sugar and butter on medium speed in a large bowl.
Slowly add in eggs, one at a time, and mix on medium speed until combined.
Reduce speed to low and add vanilla extract, milk, and sour cream.
In a separate bowl, combine both flours, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Slowly add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Using a large spoon, fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
In a small saucepan over low heat, combine diced apple with sugar and cinnamon.
Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft.
Set aside to fill cupcakes with later.
With a hand or stand mixer, beat softened butter and cream cheese together on medium speed for 3 minutes.
Add vanilla and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined.
Slowly add powdered sugar and beat on low for 1 minute.
Add cinnamon and gradually increase the speed to high and beat for 3 minutes, until fluffy.
Combine flour and next seven ingredients including apples in a medium bowl.
Heat the 2 cups vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium high heat for 3 minutes. Lower heat to medium, and using an ice cream scoop or large spoon, drop 1/4 cupfuls of batter into the hot oil.
Fry about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden. Remove fritters with a slotted spoon, and place on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.
Continue until all the batter is gone, being careful not to overcrowd the pan while frying.
While hot, sprinkle the fritters with cinnamon and sugar.
After cooled, cut fritters into pieces to top cupcakes.
Once cool, poke small holes in each cupcake, using a circle pastry tip or an apple corer. Insert one tablespoon of the Cinnamon Apple Filling into each cupcake. Gently pipe each cupcake with Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting. Garnish with an Apple Fritter Topping piece on top of each cupcake.

Salted Brown Butter Cookies
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
Coarse-flake sea salt for sprinkling (preferably fleur de sel)

Preheat the oven to 325ËF. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter until it starts to brown. When the butter has browned and is ready, the foam will have subsided and it will have turned a nutty color. Watch closely so as not to burn the butter. Pour the browned butter into a medium bowl and stir in the brown sugar and vanilla. In a small bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder together. With a spoon, stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until combined. Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls onto the cookie sheet. Sprinkle with sea salt and lightly press it into the top of cookies. Bake for 12 minutes.

Tahini Cookies
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons honey
3/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, sugar, and honey in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in tahini, then add dry ingredients in 2 batches, beating after each addition until fully combined. Dough will be slightly sticky.
Place sesame seeds in a small bowl. Scoop out heaping tablespoons of dough (about 1 oz.) and roll into balls. Dip tops of balls in sesame seeds, pressing to adhere, and place, sesame side up, on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2 inch apart. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until golden brown, 13â15 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets (cookies will firm as they cool).

Apple Pie Cookies
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, frozen 15 minutes

1/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
1 large egg
1 tablespoon milk
Demerara or raw sugar (for sprinkling; optional)
A 3 inch round cookie or biscuit cutter; a small (about 1 1/2 inch) leaf-shaped or round cookie cutter

Pulse sugar, salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs form, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water and process until dough just comes together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingertips; if it's very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not overprocess.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then divide into 2 equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disc with smooth edges and no cracks. Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
Peel, core, and slice apples into 1/4 inch-thick slices. Coarsely chop slices. Transfer to a large pot and add brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, 2 tsp. flour, and 2 Tbsp. water; stir to combine. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally and adding water 1 Tbsp. at a time if bottom starts to brown, until apples are softened but still have a little bite, about 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat egg and milk in a small bowl.
Roll 1 disc of dough to an 1/8 inch-thick round about 13 inch in diameter. Using 3 inch cutter, cut dough into 12 rounds. Transfer rounds to prepared baking sheet. Spoon 1 heaping Tbsp. filling onto each round (do not overfill). Chill on sheet until ready to use.
Roll second disc of dough to an 1/8 inch-thick round about 13 inch in diameter. Using 3 inch cutter, cut into 12 more rounds. Using leaf-shaped cutter, cut a hole in center of each round.
Brush edges of rounds with apple filling with egg wash. Place cut-out rounds over filled rounds to create sandwiches, then press down lightly around edges to seal completely. Gently press down in center to even out filling.
Brush top of sandwiches with egg wash and sprinkle with demerara sugar, if using.
Bake cookies until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, 30â35 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Loosely cover with foil and store at room temperature. Do not store in a sealed container or they will become too soft.

ChocolateâAlmond Praline Cookies
3/4 cup skin-on almonds
Nonstick vegetable oil spray (optional)
1/3 cup granulated sugar
5 tablespoon unsalted butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup bittersweet chocolate wafers (disks, pistoles, fÃ¨ves) or chocolate chips
Flaky sea salt

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet on upper rack, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 6â8 minutes. Let cool.
Gather almonds into a tight pile on a nonstick silicone baking mat or a rimmed baking sheet coated with nonstick spray. Cook granulated sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, undisturbed, until it begins to liquefy and turn golden brown around the edges. Use a heatproof rubber spatula to incorporate melted sugar into unmelted sugar and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all sugar is melted and caramel turns a medium amber color, 6â8 minutes. Carefully pour caramel over almonds and let cool.
Break almond mixture into large pieces and transfer to a food processor. Process, scraping down sides occasionally, until praline paste is very smooth and creamy, about 4 minutes.
Cook butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until it foams, then browns, about 5 minutes. Let cool until just warm.
Whisk flour, kosher salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown butter, praline paste, and brown sugar in a large bowl until mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium, add egg yolk and vanilla, and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients. Mix until mostly combined. Using a wooden spoon, mix in chocolate. Scrape out dough onto a sheet of parchment paper and roll up into a 1 3/4 inch-diameter log. Chill until very firm, at least 2 hours.
Reheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice dough into generous 1/4 inch-thick slices with a serrated knife and place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with sea salt and bake until cookies are firm around the edges and slightly darker, 9â10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.
Praline paste can be made 1 week ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Dough can be made 3 days ahead; wrap in plastic and keep chilled, or freeze up to 1 month.

Vegan Apple Cider Cupcakes
2 cups apple cider
1 tablespoon agar flakes or 1 teaspoon agar powder
2 cinnamon sticks
1/2 teaspoon whole cloves
1/2 teaspoon whole allspice
1/2 cup apple butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
Vegan Fluffy Buttercream Frosting
Brown Rice Caramel Glaze

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a muffin tray with cupcake liners.
Place apple cider, agar agar, cinnamon sticks, cloves and allspice in a small saucepan. If using agar flakes, let mixture soak for 10 minutes; if using powder, proceed to the next step.
Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
In a separate bowl, mix together the apple butter, maple syrup, sugar, vegetable oil, apple cider vinegar and vanilla.
Bring the apple cider mixture to a boil, then lower heat to bring it to a low rolling boil, careful not to let it boil over. Boil for about 15 minutes, until the cider is reduced to 1 1/4 cups and the agar agar is dissolved. (If the cider hasnât reduced enough, boil longer. If it has reduced too much, add extra apple cider to make up for the difference.) Stir frequently because the agar agar tends to stick to the sides of the pan.
Strain the apple cider and discard the spices. Let cool to lukewarm, then add the apple cider to the apple butter mixture and mix well. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients in roughly three batches, mixing well after each addition.
Spray the cupcake liners with nonstick cooking spray. Fill each liner three-quarters full. Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.
Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before frosting.
Pipe the buttercream or agave icing onto the cupcakes and sprinkle some cinnamon or cinnamon sugar on top of it. Use a spoon to drizzle the caramel over the frosting. It would be cute to stick a cinnamon stick into the frosting if you are feeling fancy-pants.

2-Minute Chocolate Chip and Pecan Cookie
1 rounded tablespoon vegan butter
2 tablespoons soft brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon pecan nuts, lightly chopped or crumbled by hand
4 tablespoons plain (all-purpose) flour
1 tablespoon dark chocolate chips

In a microwave-safe bowl, spoon in the vegan butter and melt in an 850W microwave for 30 seconds.
Stir in the brown sugar, vanilla extract, pecan nuts, and plain flour into the melted vegan butter to form a dough, then stir through the chocolate chips.
Spoon the mixture as a single cookie onto a microwave-safe plate, then microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds until cooked.

Brownie Ice-Cream Sandwich
1 x My Favorite Brownie recipe
200ml (3/4 cup) sweetened condensed milk
600ml (2 1/2 cups) heavy cream
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
100g (3.5-oz) Oreos, or cookie of your choice
You will also need two or three 20x30cm (8x12-inch) brownie tins and an electric handheld whisk.

Line one 20x30cm (8x12-inch) tin with cling film.
In a large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, heavy cream, and vanilla using an electric hand-held whisk until the mixture thickens and holds its shape when you take the whisk out. Put the cookies into a plastic bag and bash them with a rolling pin to make crumbs. If you want larger chunks, you could crumble them by hand. Fold the cookie crumbs into the ice-cream mixture, then scrape into the prepared tin. Use a spatula to smooth it out, then freeze for at least two hours or until firm.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C/160 degrees C fan/gas 4. Make My Favorite Brownie recipe up to step 4, but don't put the mixture in the tin yet.
Divide the brownie mixture between two lined 20x30cm (8x12-inch) brownie tins (or use one and bake two batches) and use a spatula to spread the batter right into the edges. It will be very thin, as these will be your sandwich layers. Bake each tray for ten minutes, then remove from the oven and leave to cool completely in the tin.
Remove the brownie layers from the tins and re-line one of the tins with another sheet of baking parchment. Put one brownie layer into the tin, then press the ice-cream layer on the top of it. Add the final layer then return to the freezer for at least 30 minutes.
Remove the ice-cream sandwich slab from the freezer about ten minutes before serving. Use a sharp knife or pastry cutter to cut shapesâI like the effect of a circular cutter.

Blackberry-Tahini Yogurt Cake
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon
4 tablespoons plus 1 cup sugar
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more
2 large eggs
1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon, lime, or orange zest
2 cups fresh (or frozen, thawed) blackberries
1/4 cup tahini

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat a 9 inch-diameter cake pan with nonstick spray; line bottom with a parchment paper round. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Mix cardamom and 2 Tbsp. sugar in a small bowl; set aside.
Whisk flour, baking powder, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add eggs, yogurt, oil, and citrus zest and whisk to combine. Switch to a wooden spoon or rubber spatula and gradually work in dry ingredients, mixing until smooth. Fold in berries; scrape batter into prepared pan.
Mix tahini, a pinch of salt, and remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar in another small bowl. Drizzle evenly over batter; sprinkle reserved cardamom sugar over top.
Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50â60 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool in pan. Invert onto a plate, then turn right side up.
Cake can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature.

Larry the Turkey Cupcakes
24 standard Pumpkin Spice cupcakes baked in white paper liners
24 mini Pumpkin Spice cupcakes baked in white paper liners
1 cup vanilla frosting
1/2 cup chocolate frosting
24 thin ginger-flavored scalloped cookies (Annaâs Ginger Thins)
2 cups candy corn
1 1/2 cups caramel jimmies
1 can (16 ounces) plus 1 cup caramel frosting
24 pieces Indian candy corn
48 brown chocolate-covered sunflower seeds (available at gourmet candy stores)
1 roll red fruit leather (Fruit by the Foot)
24 graham cracker sticks (Honey Made Graham Sticks)
12 marshmallows

Spoon the vanilla and chocolate frosting into separate ziplock bags, press out the excess air, and seal. Snip a 1/8 inch corner from the bag with the vanilla frosting and pipe a dot of frosting on 7 adjacent scallops on each ginger cookie to make the tail fan. Add a piece of candy corn to each dot of frosting, pointed end facing in.
Place the caramel jimmies in a small shallow bowl. Spread the caramel frosting on top of all the cupcakes, standard and mini, and smooth. Roll the edge of the standard cupcakes in the jimmies. Dip the top edge of the mini cupcakes in the jimmies.
Press 1 piece of Indian candy corn into the center of each mini cupcake, flat side down, for the break. Pipe 2 dots of the vanilla frosting above the break for the eyes and insert 2 brown sunflower seeds, pointed end down. Cut the red fruit leather into twenty-four 1 1/2 inch long teardrop shapes and lay them over the beak to make the wattle.
Snip a 1/8 inch corner from the bag with the chocolate frosting and pipe names on the flat side of the graham cracker cookies.
Enlarge the hole in the corner of the bag with the chocolate frosting to 1/4 inch. Using clean scissors, cut the marshmallows in half on the diagonal. Place 1 marshmallow half, cut side down, near the edge of one of the standard cupcakes, with the tapered end facing the center, to make a support for the tail. Pipe a dot of chocolate frosting on the tapered end. Place the tail cookie on the marshmallow, pressing the undecorated edge into the frosting on the marshmallow. Add the mini cupcake head on top so that half of it is resting on the undecorated edge of the cookie and the other half is pressed lightly into the frosting to secure.
Add the graham cookies at the base of the mini cupcakes, securing with a dot of frosting.
Arrange the turkeys on the table as place cards. Place 2 candy corns on the table in front of each turkey to make the feet.

Pumpkin Patch Cupcakes
12 standard Pumpkin Spice cupcakes baked in orange paper liners
24 mini Pumpkin Spice cupcakes baked in white paper liners
4 green licorice twists (Twizzlers Rainbow Twists)
1 can (16 ounces) plus 1 cup vanilla frosting
Orange food coloring (available at baking supply stores)
1 cup orange decorating sugar (available at baking supply stores)
Green licorice laces (Watermelon Madness Fruit Streamers)

Cut the licorice twists into thirty-six 3/4-inch pieces for the pumpkin stems. Tint the vanilla frosting orange with the food coloring. Tint 1/2 cup of the orange frosting a darker shade of orange with more food coloring, and spoon into a ziplock bag. Press out the excess air, seal the bag, and set aside.
Place the orange decorating sugar in a shallow bowl. Spread the lighter orange frosting on top of the cupcakes, mounding it slightly. Starting on the edge, roll the cupcake tops in the sugar to cover completely.
Use a wooden skewer to mark ridges in the top of each cupcake. Starting in the center or slightly off center, lightly press the skewer down toward the top of the paper liner to create 5 or 6 indentations. Snip a 1/16-inch corner from the bag with the darker orange frosting and pipe a line in each indentation to make the ribs. Insert a cut green twist for the stem. Arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter or a cutting board and add the green licorice laces, trimmed to various lengths, for the tendrils.

Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies
200g (about 14 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, chopped
1 cup (175g) brown sugar
3/4 cup (165g) white (granulated) sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk
1 egg
2 cups (300g) plain (all-purpose) flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon table salt
300g dark chocolate, chopped

Preheat oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F).
Place the butter and both the sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat on low speed until just combined.
Increase the speed to medium and beat for 8 minutes or until pale and creamy, scraping down the sides of the bowl.
Add the vanilla, milk and egg and beat for 2 minutes or until light and fluffy.
Sift in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and beat until combined.
Add the chocolate and stir to combine.
Roll heaped tablespoons of the mixture into balls and place on lightly greased baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper. Bake for 12â14 minutes or until golden brown.
Allow to cool on the trays for 5 minutes before transferring onto wire racks to cool.

Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath
24 chocolate cupcakes baked in brown paper liners
100 small fresh maple leaves
1 cup orange candy melting wafers (available at baking supply stores)
1 cup green candy melting wafers (available at baking supply stores)
1 cup milk chocolate melting wafers (available at baking supply stores)
1 bag (14 ounces) caramels, unwrapped
3/4 cup chocolate jimmies
1 can (16 ounces) chocolate frosting

Wash the maple leaves with warm water and pat dry on paper towels. Line several cookie sheets with wax paper. Place the orange candy, green candy, and milk chocolate melting wafers into separate microwavable bowls. Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute. Using a small, clean craft brush or your fingertip, paint spots in the 3 different colors of melted candy in an even layer (not too thin) over the top side of each leaf. While the candy is still wet, swirl the colors slightly to blend. Place the leaf on one of the cookie sheets, coated side up. Repeat with the remaining leaves. If the candy becomes too thick, reheat in the microwave for several seconds, stirring frequently. Place the cookie sheets in the refrigerator until the candy is set, about 5 minutes.
Carefully peel the leaves from the hardened candy. They come off surprisingly easily. Use a toothpick or clean tweezers to remove any small pieces of leaf that may remain. (The leaves and other candy pieces can be made up to 5 days in advance, covered, and kept in a cool dry place.)
Line a cookie sheet with wax paper. Spoon the remaining milk chocolate into a small bowl to use for the acorn tops. Soften 4 or 5 caramels at a time in the microwave for 3 to 4 seconds. Roll each caramel into an acorn (egg) shape. Place the chocolate jimmies in a small shallow bowl. Reheat the milk chocolate in the microwave, stirring often, until smooth, about 10 seconds. Dip the large end of an acorn caramel into the melted chocolate to cover about 1/4 inch. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off. While the acorn is still wet, dip the chocolate end into the jimmies to coat. Transfer to the cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining acorns. Refrigerate until set, about 5 minutes.
Spoon 1/4 cup of the chocolate frosting into a ziplock bag, press out the excess air, and seal. Spread the tops of the cupcakes with the remaining chocolate frosting and smooth. Arrange the cupcakes in pairs to make a circle on a large platter.
Gently press the leaves into the frosting on the cupcakes, overlapping them. The leaves on the edge of the right half of the wreath will sweep to the right, while those on the left half will sweep to the left. Place the acorns randomly over the cupcakes. Snip a 1/8-inch corner from the bag with the chocolate frosting and pipe a dot of frosting at the top of each acorn to make a stem.

Raspberry and Pistachio Friands
200g (1 3/4 sticks/14 Tbsp) butter, plus extra for greasing
100g (3/4 cup) pistachio nuts, plus a few extra to serve
200g (1 2/3 cups) confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting
85g (3/4 cup plus 2 1/4 Tbsp) ground almonds
85g (2/3 cup) all-purpose flour
5 large egg whites
1 small container raspberries
8- or 12-hole muffin or friand tin and a food processor.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C/160 degrees C fan/gas 4. Melt the butter in a small pan, then remove from the heat and leave to cool a little. Grease eight holes of the friand (or muffin) tin with a little bit of butter.
Blitz 85g (2/3 cup) of the pistachio nuts in a food processor with the confectioners' sugar until very finely chopped. Tip into a bowl with the ground almonds and flour and mix together. Roughly chop the remaining pistachio nuts and set aside.
Froth the egg whites lightly with a fork, then pour into the nuts and flour mixture with the melted butter and mix well.
Pour the mixture into the friand tin holes, add a few raspberries to each one, then scatter with the chopped pistachios. Bake for 20â25 minutes until the friands are risen and springy to the touch and a skewer inserted comes out clean.
Serve warm or at room temperature. Dust with a little confectioners' sugar if you like. They should be light and chewy!
Pecan Pie Friands: Make the friand recipe above, swapping pistachios for 100g (1 cup) pecans and the raspberries for 75g (2.6 oz) chewy toffee, chopped into small pieces. Sprinkle the toffee over the friand batter before baking.

Oatmeal Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
1 1/2 ounces store-bought waffle cones, lightly crushed
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 pints ice cream (any flavors)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until it foams, then browns, 5â8 minutes. Scrape brown butter and toasty solids into a heatproof measuring glass and let cool.
Process waffle cones, oats, flour, and salt in a food processor in long pulses until oats are broken up and cones are finely ground. Add brown sugar and pulse to combine. Whisk egg yolk, vanilla, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. With the motor running, slowly drizzle into food processor, then stream in brown butter; process until dough forms a ball around the blade.
Portion out slightly rounded tablespoonfuls of dough to make 26 balls (each should weigh about 3/4 oz.). Roll balls between your palms to smooth and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets, spacing 3 inch apart (the cookies will spread as they bake). Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and use the bottom of a glass to flatten each into a 2 1/2 inch round.
Bake cookies, rotating sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until golden all over and browned around the edges, 12â15 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets; use a thin metal spatula to loosen cookies from parchment. Turn half of cookies over (youâll have 2 extra).
Remove 2 pints of ice cream (same flavor) from containers (just peel away container if itâs paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2â pieces and place in a large bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter.
Using a 4-oz. ice cream scoop or 1/2-cup measuring cup, and working one at a time or in small batches, scoop out large domes of ice cream onto upside-down cookies. Top each with a right-side-up cookie, then press down gently until ice cream extends to the edges. Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet set in the freezer as you work. Repeat softening process with remaining 2 pints of ice cream and assemble remaining sandwiches.
Freeze sandwiches until ice cream is hard, about 2 hours. Cover tray with plastic wrap and freeze at least another 8 hours to let cookies soften.
Cookies can be baked 1 week ahead; transfer to a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze. Sandwiches can be assembled 5 days ahead; keep frozen.

Grilled Apricots with Almond Cream and Fregolotta
1/2 cup blanched almonds
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup fine-grind cornmeal
2 teaspoons flaky sea salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
16 ripe apricots, halved, pitted
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
Honey (for serving)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown and fragrant, 6â8 minutes. Let cool; pulse in a food processor until mostly finely ground but there are still bits of almond.
Mix almonds, flour, sugar, cornmeal, and salt in a large bowl, then add butter and vanilla and almond extracts and work in with your fingers or the handle of a sturdy wooden spoon. Scatter crumble, trying not to break it up too much, on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 20â25 minutes. Let cool.
Prepare a grill for medium heat. Brush the cut side of each apricot half with oil and grill apricots, cut side down, until lightly charred and juices start to seep out of fruit, 6â8 minutes. Using a metal spatula, carefully turn apricots and grill a minute or so until the other side is lightly charred. Transfer to a plate.
Using an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl until medium peaks form. Fold in almond extract, if using.
Divide warm apricots among plates. Spoon some whipped cream on top. Drizzle with honey and scatter fregolotta crumble over.

My Favorite Vanilla Cupcakes
175g (1 1/3 cups) all-purpose flour
200g (about 1 cup) superfine sugar
75g (5 1/4 Tbsp) butter
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
2 eggs, at room temperature
90ml (1/3 cup) whole milk, at room temperature
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
Stand mixer, 12-hole cupcake tin, and paper cupcake cases.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C/160 degrees C fan/gas 4. Line the cupcake tin with 12 cupcake cases. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, butter, and baking powder using the paddle attachment. Mix on a low speed until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. You shouldn't see any large lumps of butter. Alternatively, use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour and sugar.
In a small jug, use a fork to blend the eggs, milk, and vanilla bean paste together. Add the mixture a little at a time to the bowl, beating until it is all combined. Keep beating for a few minutes more, until the mixture is uniform and smooth with no lumps.
Divide the mixture between the cases evenly, filling each one no more than two-thirds full. Bake in the preheated oven for 16â18 minutes, until a skewer inserted comes out clean and the cakes are a pale golden brown. Donât be tempted to over-bake here; get them out as soon as the skewer is clean. The last thing you want is dry cakes!
Leave to cool for five minutes in the tin, then remove and leave to cool completely on a cooling rack. Do not attempt to core, fill or decorate them until they are cold.

Malted Milk PiÃ±ata Cake
120g (1/2 cup) butter, plus extra for greasing
125g (1/2 cup) caster sugar
250g (1 1/8 cups) soft light brown sugar
300g (2 1/3 cups) all-purpose flour
3 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp malted milk powder
1/2 tsp salt
300ml (1 1/4 cups) whole milk
3 eggs
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
50ml (1/4 cups) whole milk
2 tbsp malted milk powder
150g (2/3 cup) unsalted butter, softened
350g (2 3/4 cups) icing sugar
Approximately 300g milk bottle sweets (ideally the floury kind, they are less sticky)
Colored paper straws

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F). Grease three 18cm (7 inch) cake tins and line with parchment paper.
Put the butter, sugars, flour, baking powder, malt powder and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low until all the butter is rubbed into the dry mixture and it has a sandy texture. Alternatively, rub the butter into the dry ingredients by hand, as if you were making pastry.
In a small jug, beat together the milk, eggs and vanilla. Pour the mixture down the side of the bowl into the dry ingredients and beat until everything is mixed together. When all the liquid has been added, beat on a high speed for two minutes until it is well combined and smooth. Alternatively, you could use an electric hand-held whisk.
Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and bake in the preheated oven for 25â30 minutes until golden brown. The cake will look slightly darker than you might expect with the added malted milk powder, so be more vigilant in checking that it is ready.
Heat the milk and malted milk powder in a small saucepan. Whisk until all the lumps of powder have dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly. Set aside to cool. Beat the butter in a large bowl until smooth, then gradually add the icing sugar and cool malted milk paste. Use an electric hand-held whisk to beat the buttercream for 5â10 minutes until light and fluffy. It should hold its shape but still be fairly soft.
To assemble the cake, stack the bottom two layers on top of each other and use a circular 9cm cutter to remove the middle. Press through both layers at once to make sure the holes line up.
Put the bottom ring on a cake stand and cover the top with a layer of buttercream using a palette knife. Try not to get icing too close to the middle, because moisture on the sweets will cause them to become sticky.
Put the second ring on top of the first and fill the hole with milk bottle sweets. Make sure it is filled to the same level as the sponge or the top sponge will cave in. Cover the second ring with buttercream then add the final sponge. Thinly cover the whole cake with some of the buttercream to trap any crumbs, then chill for a minimum of 30 minutes.
Cover the cake with the remaining buttercream, placing a large dollop on the top to create a swirl. Decorate using more milk bottle sweets and coloured paper straws.

My Favorite Brownie
150g (2/3 cup, packed) light brown sugar
225g (1 cup plus 2 tbsp) superfine sugar
225g (1 cup/2 sticks) butter
150g (5.25 ounces) dark chocolate, chopped
3 eggs
115g (1 cup) plain flour
75g (3/4 cup) cocoa powder
150g (5.25 ounces/about 1 cup) chocolate chips
You will also need a 20x30cm (8x12-inch) brownie tin.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C/180 degrees C fan/gas 6 and line a 20x30cm (8x12-inch) tin with baking parchment.
Put the sugars and butter into a large saucepan and heat on medium until the butter has melted. Simmer the mixture for five minutes to allow the sugar to begin to melt, stirring all the time. It should lose its grainy appearance and the butter will combine with the sugar. Remove from the heat.
Add the chopped dark chocolate to the warm sugar and butter mixture and stir it in until it is completely melted. Leave to cool to room temperature.
When the mixture is cool enough to touch comfortably, beat in the eggs. Add the flour and cocoa powder before stirring briefly to combine. You don't want to overbeat the mixture or your brownies will become too 'cakey'. Fold through the chocolate chips and scrape into the prepared tin.
Bake for 20â25 minutes or until the top is shiny and slightly cracked. It will feel slightly underbaked, but for gooey, sticky brownies this is perfect. Leave to cool completely in the tin, then chill in the fridge for an hour to get the ultimate, fudgy center, then cut into squares.

Put the grated zucchini in a colander placed over a large bowl. Salt it lightly, tossing gently to mix. Set aside for 30 minutes to drain.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). Butter a 9x9-inch cake pan.
Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt into a bowl.
Combine the sugar, butter, oil, eggs, and vanilla in another large bowl. Using an electric mixer (handheld is fine), beat the ingredients on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until well blended. Add one-third of the dry mixture to the liquid and blend it in on low speed. Beat in half of the sour cream, followed by another third of the dry mixture, the rest of the sour cream, and the remaining dry mixture. The batter will start to get heavier late in the mixing, and you may want to do the last bit of mixing with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.
Lift the zucchini out of the colander and give it a gentle squeeze, but donât squeeze out all the moisture. Add the zucchini to the batter and fold it in with a rubber spatula until evenly mixed. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth with a spoon.
Bake the cake on the middle oven rack for 60 to 70 minutes, until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and cool thoroughly.
When the cake has cooled, prepare the glaze, rewarming it if it has firmed up. When it has thickened slightly but is still thin enough to pour easily, slowly pour it over the cake, tilting the cake to spread it around. Cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Classic Yellow Cake with Chocolate Frosting
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
3 cups cake flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup whole milk, room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
6 large egg yolks, room temperature
1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
4 cups powdered sugar
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Sprinkles (for serving; optional)
2 (9 inch) round cake pans

Arrange a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir milk and vanilla in another medium bowl.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl, scraping down sides as needed, until light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add yolks in 2 additions, scraping down bowl after each. (Batter may separate slightly; it will come back together after dry ingredients are added.)
Reduce mixer speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with milk mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Divide batter between prepared pans (slightly less than 3 cups per pan); smooth top.
Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until light golden brown, the centers spring back when gently pressed, and a tester inserted into the centers comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 30â35 minutes.
Transfer cakes to wire racks; let cool in pans at least 15 minutes. Invert cakes onto racks, peel off parchment, and let cool completely.
Using a long serrated knife, trim top dome and any bumps from each cake to create a flat surface.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter in a large bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds. Reduce mixer speed to low and add powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, scraping sides and bottom of bowl often. Increase mixer speed to medium and add cocoa powder and salt, then add milk and vanilla. Continue to beat until light and fluffy, 2â3 minutes. Cover and store at room temperature until ready to use.
Spread 1 Tbsp. frosting in the center of a platter. Place 1 cake layer, top side down, in the center. Evenly spread 1 1/2 cups frosting on top of cake with an offset spatula, pressing frosting outward toward edges. Carefully place second cake layer, top side down, over, gently pressing down to secure. Evenly spread 2 cups frosting over top and sides. Chill at least 15 minutes to let frosting set.
Spread remaining 2 cups frosting over top and sides, swirling decoratively, making sure to cover bottom of platter. Top with sprinkles, if desired. Chill at least 30 minutes or up to overnight to let frosting set.
Cake can be made 3 days ahead; wrap tightly in plastic and chill, or freeze up to 2 weeks. Frosting can be made 3 days ahead; cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly on surface, and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.

Vegan Fluffy Buttercream Frosting
1/2 cup nonhydrogenated shortening
1/2 cup nonhydrogenated margarine (we use Earth Balance)
3 1/2 cups confectionersâ sugar, sifted if clumpy
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup plain soy milk or soy creamer

Beat the shortening and margarine together until well combined and fluffy. Add the sugar and beat for about 3 more minutes. Add the vanilla and soy milk, beat for another 5-7 minutes until fluffy.

Chocolate and Passionfruit Layer Cake
Butter, for greasing
2 x My Favorite Chocolate Cake
150ml (2/3 cup) heavy cream
1 tbsp confectioners' sugar
10 tbsp Passionfruit Curd, with or without seeds
50g (1/4 cup/1/2 stick) butter
100g (3 1/2oz) dark chocolate, chopped
75g (2/3 cup) confectioners' sugar
1 tsp milk
Sprinkle of chocolate shavings, to decorate
2 [20cm (8-inch)] round tins

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/160 degrees C fan/gas 4/350 degrees F then grease two 20cm (8-inch) tins and line with baking parchment.
Make two batches of My Favorite Chocolate Cake recipe and use it to fill the tins.
Bake for 25â30 minutes until risen and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for ten minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.
Whip the cream and confectioners' sugar together in a small bowl until it forms soft peaks and holds its shape when mixed. Be careful to stop when it reaches soft peaks or you might over-whip the cream, which will ruin the finished cake.
Spread the whipped cream all over the top of one of the cake layers, then cover with spoonfuls of passionfruit curd. Carefully sandwich the second layer on top of the first.
To make the icing, melt the butter and chocolate together in a microwave or in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Remove from the heat and mix in the confectioners' sugar and the milk, then use a palette knife to spread it over the top of the cake. Sprinkle over chocolate shavings before serving. Keep any leftover cake in the fridge, where it will keep well for 2â3 days.

Toasted Marshmallow Cupcakes
60g (about 2 oz) digestive biscuits
1 x My Favorite Vanilla Cupcakes recipe
100g (3.5 oz) dark chocolate (70â80% cocoa solids)
1 tsp butter
50ml (1/4 cup) heavy cream
125g (2/3 cup) superfine sugar
75g (1/4 cup) golden syrup
2 large egg whites
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
4 squares of dark chocolate, to decorate
Electric hand-held whisk

Blitz the digestive biscuits in a food processor until they are finely ground, or put them into a sealable bag, seal the bag and crush with a rolling pin. There shouldnât be any large pieces remaining.
Make My Favourite Vanilla Cupcakes recipe, adding the digestive biscuit crumbs with the flour in step 1.
To make the filling, finely chop the chocolate and put it into a small bowl. Heat the butter and cream in a saucepan until steaming hot but not boiling, then pour over the chocolate. Remove from the heat and leave to stand for a minute before stirring to form a smooth ganache. If any lumps of chocolate remain, put the bowl into the microwave for ten seconds then stir; repeat until the lumps are gone. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or so, until it is firm and scoopable.
To make the marshmallow topping, put the sugar, golden syrup and 2 tablespoons of water into a saucepan and cook over a medium-high heat without stirring until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (244 degrees F/118 degrees C on a candy thermometer). If you don't have a thermometer, the mixture is ready when the bubbles start to stick together in the pan and it drips off a spoon in a steady stream. Remove from the heat.
Put the egg whites into a clean, grease-free bowl and whisk with an electric hand-held whisk until soft peaks form. With the whisk on low, carefully pour the hot sugar onto the egg whites, whisking all the time. When all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and whip until the sides of the bowl feel only slightly warm and the mixture is thick and glossy. Add the vanilla extract at the end. This icing is easiest to pipe when it is warm, so transfer immediately to a piping bag fitted with a large circular nozzle or with the tip cut off.
To assemble, use a sharp knife or specialist cupcake corer to make a circular incision in the center of each cupcake, remove the center and fill each one with a teaspoon of the chocolate filling.
Pipe a large mound of marshmallow topping on the top of each cupcake, covering the chocolate filling. Use a blowtorch, if you have one, to lightly brown each one, avoiding the paper case as this will burn. You could use the broiler to brown the marshmallow topping, but watch carefully because it is more difficult to control the color and prevent it burning.
To finish, chop the chocolate squares finely and sprinkle over the top of the marshmallow.

My Favorite Chocolate Cake
Butter, for greasing
125g (1 cup) plain flour
225g (about 1 cup) superfine sugar
50g (1/2 cup) cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
125ml (1/2 cup) buttermilk (cultured), or 110ml (1/2 cup) milk plus 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice
60g (4 1/4 tbsp) butter, melted
1 egg
125ml (1/2 cup) coffee (or water)
A 20cm (8-inch) tin

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/160 degrees C fan/gas 4/350 degrees F then grease a cake tin and line it with baking parchment. Put the plain flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Whisk to combine.
If you donât have buttermilk, pour the milk into a large jug and add the lemon juice. Leave to stand for five minutes until thickened.
Whisk the buttermilk/acidified milk into the melted butter and egg followed by the coffee or water.
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, whisking until a smooth batter has formed. It will be very runny, and if you are making more than one layer, the best way to divide it between the tins is to transfer the batter to a large jug. You can then use either the markings on the jug to measure the amount going into each tin, or put a tin on the scales and measure by weight. It is important to do this so that the layers are the same height and cook at the same rate.
Bake for 25â30 minutes until risen and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for ten minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.

Gingerbread Cupcakes with Lemony Frosting
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup light molasses
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup soy milk
2 tablespoons soy yogurt
1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
1/4 cup nonhydrogenated margarine, softened
1/4 vegan cream cheese, softened
2 cups confectionersâ sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon of finely grated lemon zest

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a muffin pan with paper cupcake liners.
Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt into a bowl and mix.
Whisk the oil, molasses, maple syrup, soy milk, yogurt, and lemon zest in a separate large bowl. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix just until smooth. Fold in the chopped crystallized ginger.
Fill cupcake liners two-thirds full. Bake for 19 to 22 minutes, until a knife or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before frosting.
Cream together margarine and cream cheese until just combined. Use a handheld mixer to whip while adding the confectionersâ sugar in 1/2 cup batches. Mix until smooth and creamy, then in mix in the vanilla. Add the lemon zest. Keep tightly covered and refrigerated until ready to use.

Chocolate Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup (packed) light brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 pints ice cream (any flavor)
2 pints ice cream (any other flavor)
A ruler

Whisk cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add eggs and vanilla; beat until very fluffy, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating just until combined (use a large spatula to incorporate any dry ingredients at the bottom of the bowl). Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic, pressing down to form into 1/2â-thick disks. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature until softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper into a large 1/8 inch-thick rectangle (about 16x12 inch), dusting with more flour as needed. Use a knife and a ruler (precision is key) to cut into 4x1 1/2 inch rectangles, then use a thin metal spatula to transfer rectangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. (If at any point the dough becomes too soft and sticky, slide dough with parchment onto a baking sheet and chill until firm.)
Chill dough on baking sheet while you repeat the process with the second disk of dough. You should end up with 30 cookies total. Save scraps for another use or discard. Prick cookies in several places with a fork. Bake, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until edges are firm, 12â15 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Turn half of cookies over.
Line a 13x9â baking pan, preferably straight sided, with 2 layers of plastic wrap, leaving several inches of overhang on all sides; place in freezer. Remove both pints of first ice cream flavor from containers (just peel away container if itâs paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2â pieces and place in a large bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter. Scrape ice cream into chilled pan and smooth into an even layer with a small off-set spatula. Freeze uncovered until firm, 15â20 minutes.
Repeat softening process with both pints of second flavor.
Scrape second flavor over first layer and smooth out, spreading ice cream all the way to the edges and making top as level as possible. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until ice cream is hard, at least 8 hours.
Remove ice cream from freezer, unwrap, and invert onto a cutting board; remove pan and peel off plastic. Trim sides of ice cream block to make a neat, straight-edged rectangle measuring 12x7 1/2â (yep, thereâs that ruler again). Working quickly so ice cream doesnât melt, cut block lengthwise into 5 equal rows and then crosswise into thirds so you have 15 pieces measuring about 4x1 1/2â Working with 1 brick of ice cream at a time, use a thin metal spatula to place on a flat-side-up cookie and top with a right-side up cookie. Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet set in the freezer as you work. Freeze sandwiches until ice cream is hard, about 2 hours. Cover tray with plastic wrap and freeze at least another 8 hours to let cookies soften.
Dough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled. Cookies can be baked 1 week ahead; transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze. Layered ice cream can be made 1 week ahead; keep frozen in pan. Sandwiches can be assembled 5 days ahead; keep frozen.

Ice Cream With Saffron Oil And Sesame Wafer

1 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
4 teaspoons dried edible lavender flowers or 2 tablespoons fresh edible lavender flowers
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
10 oz blueberries (1 pt)
9x5x3-inch metal loaf pan

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter and flour loaf pan, knocking out excess flour.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer or 5 with a handheld. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in zest and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and milk alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour and mixing until just incorporated.
Spoon batter into loaf pan and bake until golden and a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center comes out with crumbs adhering, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Cool cake in pan on a rack 30 minutes, then invert onto rack and cool completely.
Bring water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in lavender, then steep 30 minutes for dried lavender or 40 minutes for fresh. Pour syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding lavender. Stir in lemon juice and blueberries.
Spoon berries and syrup over slices of cake just before serving.

Sheet-Pan Brownie Thins
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for pan
1 1/4 cups sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 cold large eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup finely chopped walnuts, pecans, or mini chocolate chips

Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 325 degrees F. Very generously butter an 18x13 inch rimmed baking sheet (do not line with parchment).
Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter in a small heatproof bowl in the microwave or set over a pot of barely simmering water. Mix sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl. Pour butter over and stir until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula after each addition, until batter is thick, shiny, and smooth. Stir in flour until well incorporated, then beat vigorously for 30â40 strokes. Stir in nuts or chocolate chips.
Using a spatula, spread batter into a thin, even layer to edges and into corners of prepared sheet (batter will seem scant but brownies will rise to about 1/4 inch thick).
Bake brownies until firm to the touch and a tester inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs (not runny batter) attached, 15â18 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Cut into 36 pieces and serve.
Brownies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature, or freeze up to 6 months.

Jam Bars
1/2 cup/110g unsalted butter or coconut oil, at room temperature
1/3 cup/85g almond butter
2 Tbsp brown rice syrup or maple syrup
1 1/2 cups/150g rolled oats
1 cup/120g almond flour
1 cup/120g oat flour
6 Tbsp/90g granulated sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp sea salt, plus one pinch
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp almond extract
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 cup plus 2 Tbsp/340g jam
1 tsp lemon juice
Pinch of sea salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Line a 9 by 13-inch/23 by 33cm baking pan with parchment paper. Combine the butter or coconut oil, almond butter, and brown rice syrup or maple syrup in a large bowl and, using a wooden spoon, mix well.
Add the rolled oats, almond flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, vanilla and almond extracts, and cinnamon to the butter mixture and stir until a soft dough forms. Divide the dough into thirds. Press two-thirds of the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan and reserve the remaining one-third for the topping.
Stir together the jam, lemon juice, and salt and then spread the mixture evenly over the bottom crust.
Crumble the remaining one-third dough over the jam filling.

Double Chocolate Cupcakes With Salted Chia Pudding Frosting
1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
5 Medjool dates, pitted and chopped
1/4â1/2 teaspoon of sea salt
5 tablespoons chia seeds
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon flax meal
3 tablespoons water
1 cup chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour
1/2 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup real maple syrup
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1 cup dairy-free chocolate chips (I like Enjoy Life), plus more for garnish

Combine the coconut milk, dates, and salt in a blender and blend until the mixture is smooth. This might take a few minutes. If end up with small bits of dates, that's OK. But you don't want to see chunks or even white slivers of the coconut milk. The color should be a very light tan. Taste, and if you want to add more salt, do it now and then blend for a few more seconds (I really like the saltiness a teaspoon brings). Pour the mixture into a medium jar or container with a lid. Stir in the chia seeds. Put the frosting in the fridge, covered, for at least 6 hours (overnight is best).
Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF. Line a standard cupcake pan with 12 paper liners.
In a small bowl, combine the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. In another small bowl, make a flax egg: Mix the flax meal and water together. Let both the almond milk mixture and the flax egg rest for at least 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Combine the vanilla, maple syrup, flax egg, and almond milk mixture in a bowl. Add the wet ingredients into the dry and stir to combine. Do not overstir. Pour in the coconut oil and chocolate chips and give it a few more stirs, until just combined.
Fill each cupcake liner with 1/4 cup of the batter. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until a fork or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let your cupcakes cool on a wire rack if you have one. When they're completely cool, top them with the frosting. Sprinkle a few more chocolate chips on top.

Classic Snickerdoodle Cookies

Pour 1 inch of water into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Set a large heatproof bowl on top to create a double boiler (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water). Put the bittersweet chocolate and butter in the bowl and gently melt. Stir until smooth.
Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until combined and smooth. Carry on whisking in the maple syrup, vanilla, salt, baking powder, and cocoa powder until incorporated. Fold in the flour, pecans, and chocolate chips until the batter is smooth.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the brownie cool slightly in the pan for about 10 minutes, then serve with the ice cream, crushed pecans, and fresh mint. Delicious!

Hungarian Golden Pull-Apart Cake with Walnuts and Apricot Jam (Aranygaluska)
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup (235 ml) warm milk
1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar, plus 2 tablespoons
4 large eggs
Zest of 1 orange
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup plus 4 tablespoons (2 1/2 sticks/282 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature, divided
4 1/2 cups (600 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour (about)
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups (180 grams) ground walnuts
6 tablespoons (83 grams) brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
3 tablespoons cake or butter cookie crumbs
3/4 cup (150 grams) apricot or plum jam

Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in the bowl of a standing mixer equipped with a paddle attachment. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar, the eggs, orange zest, vanilla, and 1 stick of butter. Gradually add the flour and salt, beating until mixed. Cover the bowl and leave for an hour, or until the dough has about doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and butter a 10-inch round pan with some of the second stick of butter.
Melt what is left of the second stick of butter plus the remaining half stick and put it in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the walnuts, brown sugar, remaining white sugar, cinnamon, and the cake or cookie crumbs.
Roll the dough into a 1/2-inch-thick circle. Using a 1-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut circles of dough. Dip the circles first in the butter, then in the nut mixture and set in the pan, almost touching each other. After a layer is completed, spoon on dollops of jam. Make a second layer, filling in the holes with dough, then jam, continuing and rerolling until the dough is used up, ending with the walnut topping but not the jam. Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown and set. Leave in the pan for a few minutes, then turn onto a plate and serve warm. You can either cut the cake or pull the sections apart. Serve for a sweet breakfast treat, or as a dessert, served with good vanilla or rum raisin ice cream.

Flourless Cacao Fudge Cake
200g (about 14 tablespoons) unsalted butter, chopped
3/4 cup (75g) raw cacao powder, plus extra for dusting
6 eggs
1 1/4 cups (220g) brown sugar
1 cup (120g) almond meal (ground almonds)

Preheat oven to 160 degrees C (320 degrees F). Lightly grease a 22cm springform cake tin and line with non-stick baking paper. Place the butter and cacao in a saucepan over low heat and stir until smooth. Place the eggs and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until doubled in volume. Add the cacao mixture and almond meal and gently fold to combine. Pour into the tin and bake for 35â40 minutes or until just set. Allow to cool in the tin. Turn out and dust with extra cacao to serve.

Mirror Cake Glaze
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (3 packets)
1 3/4 cups sugar
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 1/2 cups white chocolate chips (about 15 ounces)
3â4 different shades of food coloring

Stir gelatin and 1/2 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl and let sit 5 minutes.
Cook sugar, condensed milk, vanilla, salt, and 3/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Add bloomed gelatin and stir until dissolved.
Remove from heat and add chocolate chips, stirring constantly, until melted. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, then divide glaze among 3 or 4 bowls. Color each with food coloring as desired. Let cool, stirring occasionally to stop a skin from forming, until glaze is just cool enough to touch (100â95 degrees F), 10â12 minutes.
Pour half of color one into a large bowl, then pour half of color two into the center, followed by half of color three and half of color four, if using. Repeat with remaining glaze to form concentric circles of different colors in bowl.
Set a chilled, smoothly frosted cake on a cake pan or overturned bowl set inside a rimmed baking sheet or large tray to catch drips. Pour colored glaze over, sweeping back and forth across cake as you pour, to form a marbled pattern. Resist the temptation to touch glaze once itâs poured; it will start to set as soon as it hits the cold cake. Let glaze drip about 10 minutes, then clean up edges with a small offset spatula or butter knife. Transfer cake to a serving platter and chill at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day.
Using a warmed sharp knife, cut cleanly through cake, wiping knife with a warm damp towel between each slice.

Strawberry Shortcake Cupcakes
2 large egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon rum extract
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Seeds from 1 vanilla bean
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 3/4 cups sugar
2 large eggs
2 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups whole milk
Seeds from 1 vanilla bean
1 cup fresh strawberries, diced
16 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 cups sifted confectionersâ sugar
1 teaspoon whole milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup diced strawberries
24 fresh strawberries, sliced

In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer, mix the egg yolks and the sugar for 4 to 5 minutes.
In another large bowl, sift together the flour and the cornstarch.
Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture slowly, mixing on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth.
In a medium saucepan, warm the milk on medium heat, just until it starts to boil.
Switch your mixer to the whisk attachment, then add the hot milk slowly to the mixer, and whisk continuously at medium speed while pouring the milk, to keep the mixture smooth, without lumps or curdles.
Add the heavy cream, rum extract, vanilla extract, and vanilla bean seeds and mix thoroughly for 2 to 3 minutes.
Then pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat until it boils. Note: It must be hand-whisked constantly during this time. After it reaches boiling, whisk for 2 more minutes, until it thickens.
Remove from heat. Let it come to room temperature before pouring in a bowl. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to chill.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two cupcake pans with twelve paper baking cups each, or grease pans with butter if not using baking cups.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl, and set aside.
Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer. Add the sugar; beat on medium speed until well incorporated, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly after each addition.
Combine the vanilla extract and milk in a large liquid measuring cup. Carefully scrape the vanilla bean seeds from the milk.
Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the milk mixture, beating slowly until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by another third of the milk mixture. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining milk mixture, and beat just until combined.
Using a spatula, gently fold into the strawberries.
Scoop batter into baking cups so that each is two-thirds full, and bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcake comes our clean. Transfer the pans to a wire rack to cool completely.
Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer. Beat until well incorporated and the frosting is light and fluffy, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
Once cooled, peel the wrappers off the strawberry cupcakes and slice in half length-wise. Add a tablespoon of the filling on top of the bottom half of the strawberry cupcake; add a layer of sliced strawberries; cover with the top to make a cupcake âsandwichâ; then frost with a swirl and garnish with a strawberry slice.

1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried or powdered egg whites
Pinch of kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract

Pulse raspberries in a food processor until finely ground (you should have a scant 1/4 cup). Sift powdered sugar and raspberry powder through a very fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard raspberry seeds.
Whisk dried egg whites and 1 Tbsp. warm water in a small bowl until frothy. Whisk in salt.
Pour egg white mixture into raspberry mixture and stir with a spatula until thick but fully incorporated. Stir in lemon extract. Mixture should be smooth, satiny, and very thick; if it seems too stiff to stir, add 1/2 tsp. water.
Fit a pastry bag with a #2 round icing tip, if using. Transfer mixture to pastry bag or plastic bag (cut off 1 corner before piping to make a very small opening). Pipe long, straight lines, small hearts, dots, letters, or any other favorite shape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet.
Let sit at room temperature until hardened, at least 8 hours or up to 1 day (to speed up drying, you can also bake sprinkles in a 150 degrees F oven 2â2 1/2 hours). Break sprinkles piped into lines into various lengths, if desired.
Sprinkles can be made 1 week ahead; store in an airtight container at room temperature.

BA's Best Chocolate Macaroon Cake
1 cup virgin coconut oil, melted, cooled, plus more for pan
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for pan
1 cup skin-on almonds
8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
6 large eggs, room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon light agave nectar or pure maple syrup
Pinch of kosher salt
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk (from a very well shaken 13.5-ounce can)
2 tablespoons unsweetened coconut flakes
1 tablespoon sliced almonds
1 teaspoon granulated sugar

Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush a 10 inch-diameter cake pan with oil. Line the bottom with a round of parchment; brush parchment with oil. Dust sides of pan with cocoa powder; tap out excess. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and slightly darkened, 8â10 minutes. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F.
Meanwhile, heat chocolate and 1 cup oil in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (donât let bowl touch the water), stirring often, until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat.
Pulse almonds, salt, and 1/4 cup cocoa in food processor until nuts are finely ground. Add shredded coconut and pulse a couple of times to combine.
Beat eggs on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until no longer streaky, about 20 seconds. Add both sugars and vanilla, increase speed to high, and beat until mixture is pale, thick, and starts to hold the marks of the whisk, about 2 minutes (it should fall off the whisk and immediately sink back into itself). Switch to the paddle attachment and with mixer on low speed, gradually add chocolate mixture. Beat to incorporate, then mix in almond mixture. Fold batter several times with a rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.
Bake cake until firm to the touch and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean but greasy, 35â45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool 15â20 minutes in pan (cake might fall slightly in the center; thatâs okay). Run a paring knife or small offset spatula around edges of cake; invert onto rack. Carefully peel away parchment; let cool completely.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine chocolate, 1 Tbsp. agave nectar, and salt in a medium bowl. Bring coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over low; pour over chocolate mixture. Let sit until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toss coconut flakes, almonds, sugar, and remaining 1 tsp. agave nectar on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden, about 4 minutes. Let almond-coconut mixture cool, then break into smaller clusters.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat chocolate mixture until it has lost its sheen and is thick enough to hold very soft peaks, 6â8 minutes (ganache wonât be quite as thick as frosting but close).
Working quickly before ganache starts to set, scrape on top of cake and spread to edges with a small offset spatula or knife. Top with almond-coconut clusters.
Cake can be baked and cooled 1 day ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature until ready to serve.

Ginger and Almond Bars
3 tablespoons (45 g) unsalted butter
1 3/4 cups (165 g) almond meal (also called almond flour or almond powder)
2 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
3 tablespoons mild honey, such as clover
1 large egg, free-range and organic, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
4 tablespoons (60 g) unsalted butter
1 cup (80 g) sliced almonds
1/3 cup (45 g) minced candied ginger
1/3 cup (80 ml) mild honey, such as clover
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
A 9-1/2-inch (24 cm) square baking pan; baking parchment; a 2-quart (2 l) saucepan; a baking rack.

Center a rack in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line the pan with baking parchment, letting the parchment hang over the sides. (This will make it easier to remove the dessert once baked.)
In the saucepan, melt the butter. Add the almond meal, fresh ginger, honey, egg, salt, and vanilla. Stir until well combined. The mixture should be thick and sticky.
Turn the mixture out into the prepared pan. To help make a level and even base, place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the base. Using a flat-bottomed glass (or your fingers), smooth out the base by pressing gently to evenly cover the bottom of the pan. Remove and discard the plastic wrap. Bake until the base is slightly firm, 12 to 15 minutes.
In the same saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the almonds, candied ginger, honey, salt, and vanilla. Stir just until the ingredients are incorporated.
When the base is baked, spread the topping evenly over the base and bake until the topping is dark and sizzling, 12 to 15 minutes. Do not underbake.
Transfer the pan to the baking rack to cool. When the dessert is completely cool, remove it from the pan using the overhanging parchment as handles and cut it into 16 even squares.
Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
Chestnut Honey Squares: For the base, replace 1 cup (90g) almond meal with 3/4 cup (120 g) unbleached, all-purpose flour and use a strong honey, such as chestnut, in place of the mild honey. For the topping, replace the candied ginger with organic candied orange or lemon peel, cut into tiny cubes.

Chocolate, Pistachio, and Tahini Truffles
1 cup tahini
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1 cup shelled roasted, salted pistachios
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons toasted white sesame seeds

Heat tahini, chocolate, honey, salt, cinnamon, and orange zest in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or microwave in short bursts, stirring in between bursts, until melted and smooth.
Carefully pour tahini mixture into a glass or metal tall-sided baking pan (an 8x8 inch pan works well). Chill until truffle base is firm, 60â70 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely chop pistachios by hand or with a food processor. Mix pistachios and sesame seeds in a medium bowl.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Scoop tahini mixture by the tablespoonful and quickly roll into 1 inch balls between the palms of your hands. Toss in pistachio-sesame mixture until coated. Using a spoon, gently transfer to prepared sheet.
Truffles can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 15 minutes before serving.

Grapefruit-Vanilla Shortbread
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces, plus more for pan
1 tablespoon finely grated grapefruit zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup plus 1 cup powdered sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more
2 tablespoons fresh grapefruit juice
Himalayan pink salt, dried hibiscus flowers, red sprinkles or sanding sugar, dried rose petals, and/or cracked pink peppercorns (for serving; optional)
A 9-inch springform pan

Lightly butter pan. Pulse grapefruit zest, vanilla extract, 1/2 cup butter, and 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a food processor until smooth and homogenous. Add flour and 1/2 tsp. kosher salt; pulse just to combine. Press dough evenly into prepared pan, smoothing top with a flat-bottomed glass or measuring cup. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prick shortbread all over with a fork 1 inchâ2 inch apart, and bake until edges are golden and center is pale but firm to the touch, 15â18 minutes.
Remove band from pan and immediately cut shortbread into 16 wedges. Let cool.
Whisk grapefruit juice, a pinch of kosher salt, and remaining 1 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl until smooth. Spread a thin layer of icing over shortbreads with a small offset spatula, leaving a thin border of crust exposed. Top as desired. Let sit 10â15 minutes to allow glaze to set. Retrace cut marks.
Dough can be pressed into pan 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

2 tablespoon light corn syrup
12 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped
2 tablespoon virgin coconut oil
Pearl sugar and/or red sanding sugar (for serving; optional)
Red luster dust (for serving; optional)
A 1â1 1/4-inchâdiameter cookie cutter; candy thermometer

Whisk almond flour and rice flour in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer, on medium speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, powdered sugar, and salt until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and beat in egg yolk, then dry ingredients.
Roll out dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 1/4 inch thick. Using parchment, slide dough onto a baking sheet and chill until firm, 30â40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Peel away top layer of parchment paper from dough and punch out rounds with cutter; transfer cookies to another parchment-lined large baking sheet, spacing at least 1 inch apart. (You should have 36 cookies; if desired, gather scraps and save for another use.)
Bake cookies until edges are golden but centers are still pale, 10â12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.
Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside. Transfer cooled cookies to rack.
Pulse strawberries in a food processor until finely ground. Pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl to remove larger pieces; set strawberry powder aside.
Place 1/4 cup cold water in a small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top; let sit until gelatin is softened, 10â15 minutes.
Beat egg whites, salt, and 2 tsp. granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed to soft peaks.
Heat corn syrup, remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 3 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring with a heatproof spatula until sugar is dissolved. Fit saucepan with thermometer and bring syrup to a boil; cook, brushing down sides of saucepan with a wet pastry brush to dissolve any crystals, until thermometer registers 242 degrees F. Working quickly through the next few steps, immediately remove syrup from heat and add gelatin mixture, stirring with spatula just until melted. With mixer on medium speed, gradually stream syrup into egg whites, aiming for the space between the sides of the bowl and the whisk. Increase speed to high and beat until marshmallow is very light, thick, and glossy and the sides of the bowl feel cool to the touch, 10â12 minutes. Beat in reserved strawberry powder.
Transfer marshmallow mixture to a disposable pastry bag and snip a 1 inch opening off the end (or use a resealable plastic bag and cut off 1 corner). Position end of piping bag 1/2 inch from surface of cookie, holding bag perpendicular; applying even pressure, begin slowly piping (do not move the bag). Pipe until marshmallow has expanded to the diameter of the cookie, then slowly lift the tip upward to create a soft peak. (Imagine a tall Hersheyâs Kiss shape about 2 inch high.) When all the cookies have been topped with marshmallow, chill uncovered on baking sheet until marshmallow is set, 2â2 1/2 hours. (Loosely cover at this point and chill up to 12 hours if desired.)
Heat chocolate and oil in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let water touch bottom of bowl), stirring until chocolate is melted and incorporated. Let cool slightly.
Drizzle a level tablespoon of chocolate mixture over each marshmallow cookie, coating completely. Sprinkle with pearl and/or sanding sugar if desired.
Once all cookies have been coated, use a small offset spatula to nudge at the base across the rack to remove any drips. Chill until chocolate is set, at least 30 minutes. Decorate with luster dust if desired.

Fruity Rum Bundt Cake
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup dried tart cherries
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons gold rum, divided
3 tablespoons plus 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
5 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (or more) sour cream
2 cups raw sugar, plus more for serving
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
7 large egg yolks
1 large egg
1 cup powdered sugar
A 12-cup Bundt pan

Combine apricots, cherries, raisins, and 1/2 cup rum in a small bowl and let sit 30 minutes to allow fruit to rehydrate. Drain, reserving rum. Sprinkle fruit with 3 Tbsp. flour and toss to coat; set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly butter pan, making sure to get into all the curved or ridged places; dust pan with flour (do this even if your pan has a nonstick coating). Whisk baking powder, salt, cloves, and 3 cups flour in a medium bowl to combine. Whisk reserved rum, oil, and 1 1/4 cups sour cream in another medium bowl to combine.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 2 cups raw sugar and remaining 1 cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; reserve pod for another use. Add egg yolks and egg one at a time, beating to blend after each addition; beat until mixture is light and very fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with sour cream mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Fold in reserved dried fruit. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top. Tap pan firmly a few times on counter to force batter into edges of pan.
Bake cake until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60â70 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving plate; carefully remove pan and brush warm cake with remaining 2 Tbsp. rum. Let cool completely, about 3 hours.
Mix powdered sugar and remaining 2 Tbsp. sour cream in another small bowl, thinning with more sour cream if desired (the thinner the glaze, the further it will drip down the sides of the cake), until smooth. Drizzle glaze over cake, working along the center of the top of the cake for even coverage, and sprinkle with raw sugar. Let sit 10 minutes for glaze to set before slicing with a serrated knife.
Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Do not glaze. Store loosely covered at room temperature.

Gather up scraps and reroll once. Chill cookies on baking sheets until firm, 5â10 minutes, then bake until edges are golden brown, 12â18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on baking sheet; transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
If using royal icing, decorate cooled cookies and let dry 2 hours.
Dough can be made 1 month ahead; freeze instead of chilling. Cookies can be baked 2 weeks ahead (do not decorate with royal icing); place in airtight container and freeze.

Dulce de Leche Brownies
Nonstick baking spray
5 (1-ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
2 cups sugar
4 eggs
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 (14-ounce) can dulce de leche

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Generously spray an 8-inch square baking pan or an 8x10-inch baking pan with nonstick baking spray.
Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and nuke it in about 45-second intervals, stirring each time, until itâs completely melted. Set it aside to cool for 20 minutes or so.
Add the butter and the sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream them together until theyâre light and fluffy.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
With the mixer on low, slowly drizzle in the chocolate until itâs all combined. Add the flour and the vanilla. And mix until itâs all combined, scraping the sides of the bowl halfway through.
Spread the batter into the greased pan.
Next, crack open the can of dulce de leche and place half of it in a glass bowl. Warm it in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds, just to make it a little more stirrable.
Drop large dollops of dulce de leche on the surface of the batter then use a knife to slowly swirl it through the brownie batter. Donât drag the knife sideways through the batter; hold it so the thin side of the knife leads the way.
Bake the brownies for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the center is almost totally set.
Let the brownies cool in the pan for 15 minutes then use a very sharp serrated knife to cut the brownies into squares and place them on a pretty cake stand.

Black-and-White Halvah
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
3/4 cup white tahini
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 1/3 cups sugar, divided
3/4 cup black tahini
A candy thermometer

Lightly coat an 8 1/2x4 1/2 inch loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2 inch overhang on long sides. Place a sheet of parchment paper on work surface and lightly coat with nonstick spray. Beat white tahini and 1/2 tsp. salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed just until smooth.
Meanwhile, place 2/3 cup sugar in a small saucepan and remaining 2/3 cup sugar in another small saucepan. Add 1/4 cup water to each saucepan and set both saucepans over low heat. Cook, stirring with a rubber spatula to dissolve, about 4 minutes. Keep 1 saucepan over low and increase heat to medium-high for other saucepan and fit with thermometer. Cook syrup, brushing down sides of saucepan with a wet pastry brush to dissolve any crystals, until thermometer registers 248 degrees F, 7â10 minutes.
Immediately remove saucepan with boiling syrup from heat. Increase mixer speed to medium and gradually stream syrup into white tahini, aiming for the space between the sides of the bowl and the paddle. Beat just until halvah comes together in a smooth mass, less than a minute. (Do not overmix or it will be crumbly.) Working quickly, scrape onto prepared parchment and flatten with spatula until 3/4 inch thick. Invert a medium bowl over halvah to keep warm.
Rinse any hardened sugar off thermometer; clip to second saucepan. Increase heat to medium-high and cook syrup, brushing down sides of saucepan with wet pastry brush, until thermometer registers 248 degrees F, about 4 minutes.
While the syrup is cooking, briefly beat black tahini and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt in the same bowl of stand mixer (no need to clean it out unless you have lots of hardened sugar stuck around sides) until smooth. Stream in syrup and mix just until halvah comes together in a smooth mass.
Uncover white halvah (it should still be warm) and scrape black halvah on top; flatten to about the same shape as the white halvah. Using the sides of the parchment to lift edges, fold stacked halvah in half and flatten slightly. Repeat folding and flattening motions 4â5 times, rotating halvah as you work, to create a marbled effect (be careful not to work it too much or mixture will be crumbly). Press into prepared pan. Fold sides of parchment paper over top of halvah and let cool, at least 3 hours.
Lift halvah out of pan using parchment overhang. Peel away parchment; cut halvah crosswise into 1/2 inch-thick slices.
Halvah can be made 3 days ahead. Leave in pan. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Christmas Glazed Apple Cake (Weihnachten Gedeckter Apfelkuchen)
2 1/3 cups, scooped and leveled, plus 1 tablespoon/300g all-purpose flour
3/4 cup/150g plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, divided
1 teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
10 1/2 tablespoons/150g unsalted high-fat, European-style butter, softened
1 egg, at room temperature
6 large apples (2 pounds 10 ounces/1.2kg)
Juice of 1 lemon plus 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 1/4 teaspoon Lebkuchen Spice Mix
1 cup fresh cranberries
1/4 cup/60ml plus 2 teaspoons water
3/4 cup/75g confectionersâ sugar

Mix the flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut the butter into cubes and add to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your hands, work the butter into the flour until itâs no longer visible. Add the egg and knead until the dough is smooth. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
Peel, core, and quarter the apples. Cut them into slices 1/8 to 1/4 inch/3 to 6mm thick and put the slices in a large pot. Add the juice of 1 lemon along with the Lebkuchen Spice and the 1/4 cup/60ml of water. Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook the apples for 15 to 20 minutes, or until silky and relatively broken down. The apples should not turn completely to mush but still retain some shape. Take the pot off the heat and stir in the cranberries and the remaining 1 Tbsp granulated sugar.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Line the bottom of a 9-inch/23cm springform pan with parchment paper. Take two-thirds of the dough and pat it evenly into the springform pan, forming a 1-inch-/2.5cm-high rim at the edges. Refrigerate the remaining dough. Prick the dough in the pan evenly all over with a fork. Line the dough with a sheet of aluminum foil and fill the pan with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the crust is starting to firm up but is not yet browning. Remove from the oven and carefully remove the aluminum foil and pie weights; maintain the oven temperature.
Scrape the apple mixture evenly into the par-baked shell and smooth the top. The apple filling should precisely fill the crust. Roll out the remaining one-third of the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap until just slightly larger than the circumference of the pan. Trim the edges of the circle and then gently transfer the circle to the top of the cake, laying it over the apple filling. Tuck in the top crust and cut off any excess. Cut 3 small slits in the top of the dough. Put the pan back in the oven and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and slightly puffed.
Remove the pan from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes while you prepare the glaze. Sieve the confectionersâ sugar into a small bowl and whisk in the 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and the 2 teaspoons of water until smooth. Brush the glaze over the still-hot cake and then let the cake cool completely before serving. The cake will keep at room temperature, covered lightly with plastic wrap, for 2 to 3 days.

Hazelnut and Buckwheat Financiers With Figs
3/4 cup skin-on hazelnuts
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
1/3 cup buckwheat flour
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
4 large egg whites
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
3 fresh or dried figs, cut lengthwise into 6 wedges (optional)
Demerara or raw sugar (for sprinkling)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toast hazelnuts on a large rimmed baking sheet until skins are slightly darkened and split, 12â15 minutes. Let cool, then bundle in a kitchen towel and rub vigorously to remove skins (there will definitely be some stubborn pieces that refuse to come offâdo what you can). Transfer to a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Whisk hazelnuts, powdered sugar, buckwheat flour, and salt in a medium bowl to combine.
Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until it foams, then browns (be careful not to let it burn), 5â7 minutes. Let cool slightly.
Whisk egg whites in a medium bowl until foamy (youâre not trying to create volume; you just want to break them up), then whisk into dry ingredients. Whisk in brown butter. Cover and chill batter until firm, at least 2 hours.
Reheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously coat six 4-oz. fluted financier molds or a standard 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick spray. Divide batter among molds (use about 1/3 cup batter per mold, or 2 mounded Tbsp. if using a muffin pan). Top with figs (if using) and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake until tops are browned and edges are firm, 20â25 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let financiers cool 10 minutes in pans before turning out onto racks. Let cool completely.
Batter can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.

3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large eggs
3 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cups heavy cream, divided
A 9 inch cake pan (preferably springform)

Peel pears. Using a 1/2 tsp. measuring spoon or small melon baller, scoop upward from bottom of pears 1 1/2â2 inch to remove core and seeds; discard. Combine pears, wine, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, vanilla, and 3 cups water in a large, heavy pot. Cut a round of parchment to fit just inside pot and cover pears.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, turning pears occasionally to coat with liquid, until pears are very tender but not falling apart, 20â25 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pears to a large bowl and cover with parchment round.
Bring poaching liquid to a boil, then cook over medium heat until reduced to the consistency of thick syrup, 12â15 minutes (you should have 1/2 cup). Transfer 5 pears to a medium bowl, reserving remaining pears for cake, and pour syrup over. Cover with parchment and let cool, or chill overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cake pan with butter and line bottom with parchment paper.
Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 6â8 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl.
Pulse 1/2 cup dry ingredients and 3/4 cup hazelnuts in a food processor until hazelnuts are chopped into a fine flour; reserve remaining hazelnuts. Transfer chopped hazelnuts to bowl with dry ingredients.
Wipe out food processor bowl and add 5 poached pears. Pulse until smooth. Transfer 2 cups to a small bowl; discard leftover purÃ©e.
Beat brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, and 3/4 cup butter on medium-high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, 3â5 minutes. Scrape down bowl and add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add half of pear purÃ©e and beat on low speed. Add half of flour mixture and beat on low to incorporate. Beat in remaining pear purÃ©e and flour mixture until combined. Pour into prepared pan; smooth top. Set pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake cake, rotating sheet halfway through, until center is set and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool.
Turn chilled pears in liquid to coat, then transfer liquid (about 1/2 cup) to a small saucepan. Add chocolate and 3/4 cup cream and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, just until chocolate is melted. Whisk to combine, then transfer to a medium bowl. Chill, stirring occasionally so chocolate doesn't set, until room temperature, about 10 minutes.
Remove cake from pan, trim top with a serrated knife if domed, and invert onto a 12 inch platter. Remove parchment. Using a toothpick, poke holes all over top of cake. Using a pastry brush, brush top with 1/4 cup chocolate sauce.
Meanwhile, coarsely chop remaining 1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts. Whip remaining 3/4 cup cream to medium-soft peaks in stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.
Top cake with whipped cream, pears, and hazelnuts. Drizzle chocolate sauce over pears. Serve remaining chocolate sauce alongside.
Cake and pears can be made 2 days ahead; cover in separate containers and chill.

Double Chocolate Espresso Cookies
18 tablespoons (2 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons instant espresso powder, like Medaglia DâOro, or similar
12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips

Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at time, mixing after each addition to make sure they are well combined.
In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder. I use a whisk to make sure they are well blended.
With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Mix everything until the ingredients are fully combined, but do not overbeat. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the chocolate chips.
Line a baking sheet with a Silpat mat or parchment paper. Using a 1 1/2-inch ice cream scoop or a rounded teaspoon, drop the dough on the sheet 2 inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tops look dry. Do not overbake, or the cookies will not be chewy. Cool on a wire rack and serve.

Yeasted Apple Coffee Cake
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, plus more
1 1/4-ounce envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
2/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar, divided
1 large egg, room temperature
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup sour cream, room temperature
2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest
1/3 cup fresh orange juice
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Kosher salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled
2 pounds firm baking apples (about 4 large), halved, cored, very thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons (or more) fresh orange juice

Butter a 13x9 inch shallow baking dish. Mix yeast, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1/4 cup warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer; let sit until it foams, about 5 minutes. Whisk in egg and remaining brown sugar, then stir in 1 cup flour and mix with a wooden spoon to incorporate. Sprinkle remaining 2 cups flour over top but do not mix in. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until mixture is visibly puffed and flour has cracks in places, 60â90 minutes.
Add sour cream, orange zest, orange juice, baking powder, and salt to mixture and mix on medium speed with dough hook until smooth, elastic, and just sticking to the sides of bowl, about 4 minutes. Add 6 Tbsp. butter in 2 additions, beating well between additions; beat until a soft, slightly glossy, sticky dough-batter hybrid forms, about 4 minutes.
Using buttered fingers, pat dough into prepared pan in an even layer, spreading to edges. Cover and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until puffed and nearly doubled in size, 60â70 minutes.
Just before dough is finished rising, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pulse flour, oats, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt in a food processor a few times to combine. Add butter and process in long pulses until streusel is the consistency of moist crumbs.
Working with several slices at a time, fan out apples slightly and arrange over dough, shingling rows in different directions; sprinkle streusel over top. Bake until apples are tender and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35â45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
Whisk powdered sugar, orange juice, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl, adding more orange juice by the teaspoonful as needed, until icing is very thick and smooth and falls back onto itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon. Drizzle over coffee cake.

Ombre Christmas Tree Cookies
All-purpose flour (for dusting)
1 batch All-in-One Sugar Cookie Dough, chilled
2 cups white royal icing
Sanding sugar in 3 shades of green and gold dragees (for decorating)
3 inchâ5 inch tree cookie cutters; a small offset spatula

Position racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
Generously flour a rolling pin and work surface. Working with 1 disc at a time, roll dough to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out as many cookies as possible with cookie cutters (if dough becomes too soft, chill until firm). Place cookies 1/2 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Chill 15 minutes.
Bake cookies until edges are light golden brown, 10â12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.
Using small offset spatula, frost trees with icing. While still wet, decorate each cookie in 3 sections to create an ombre effectâstart by covering bottom third with darkest green sanding sugar. Sprinkle the medium green shade in the center, then the light green shade over the top third. Tap cookie lightly to remove excess sprinkles. Top tips of trees with gold dragees to look like a tree topper. Let icing dry before storing cookies, about 3 hours.
Cookies can be made 10 days ahead; store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Chocolate Blackout Cookies
1 large egg white
1 3/4 cups powdered sugar
4 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch process
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 large eggs, room temperature
1 1/4 cups (packed) dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces

Whisk egg white in a medium bowl just to loosen. Add powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp. water and whisk until smooth. Mixture should be smooth, satiny, and very thick. If mixture is too thick or gloppy, whisk in another 1/2 tsp. water. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag and snip off end of bag (or use a resealable plastic bag and cut off 1 corner) to make a very small opening.
Pipe icing in very thin, very straight lines across a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing close together (if icing does not squeeze out of bag easily, snip a slightly larger opening). Keep piping until youâve covered the entire sheet of parchment (discard leftover icing or save for another use). Let sit at room temperature until hardened, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day (to speed up drying, you can also bake sprinkles in a 150 degrees F oven for 2â2 1/2 hours). Lift ends of parchment to break sprinkles into various lengths, then gently roll your fingers over top to loosen from parchment paper.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let water touch bottom of bowl), stirring until melted and mixture is smooth. Let cool.
Meanwhile, sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, espresso powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl until thick and light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add chocolate mixture; mix just to combine. Turn off mixer. Add dry ingredients and pulse mixer on low until no dry spots remain. If dough is very soft, cover and chill until firm enough to scoop, 10â15 minutes.
Using a 1 1/2 oz. scoop (or a scant 1/4 cup), portion out dough and roll into balls between your palms (if dough becomes very sticky while rolling, chill for a few minutes). Place balls on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing at least 2 inch apart; flatten slightly. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets once, until centers are puffed and edges are just firm,13â18 minutes. Let cookies cool 20 minutes on baking sheets, then peel away parchment and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool completely.
Heat chocolate, cream, corn syrup, and salt in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let water touch bottom of bowl), stirring until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Let cool.
Whisk powdered sugar and vanilla into chocolate mixture, then add butter 1 piece at a time, whisking to incorporate fully after each addition. Whisk until icing looks smooth and glossy.
Using an offset spatula, spread about 1 Tbsp. icing over each cookie and top with sprinkles.
Sprinkles can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Gingersnap Peach Upside-Down Cake
4 to 5 cups peeled and sliced fresh peaches (5 or 6 peaches)
1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
1/4 cup unsalted butter, plus 2 tablespoons, softened
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 cup crushed gingersnap cookies (8 to 12 cookies)
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup half-and-half
Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, to serve

Line the slow cooker with a large sheet of parchment paper, letting the ends reach over the rim, and pushing the paper firmly into the bottom of the slow cooker insert. Generously spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine the peaches and crystallized ginger. Set aside.
In a small saucepan on the stovetop over medium heat, melt 1/4 cup of the butter. Stir in the brown sugar. Pour this mixture into the slow cooker and spread evenly over the bottom. Next, spoon the peach and crystallized ginger mixture over the butter mixture. Do not stir. Then sprinkle with the gingersnap cookie crumbs.
Use a hand-held mixer to cream together the white sugar, shortening, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of softened butter in a bowl. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and mix in. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the half-and-half to the creamed sugar mixture. Mix well and spoon on top of the gingersnap layer, spreading the mixture a bit, but not mixing it. Everything should be layered.
Place several layers of paper towels over the slow cooker and replace the lid. Turn the slow cooker to high and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean.
Remove the lid from the slow cooker and cook an additional 15 to 20 minutes for the top to form a crust.
Lift the cake from the slow cooker using the long ends of the parchment paper and place on a large dinner plate. Place a second dinner plate on top. Holding both plates, carefully flip it over and remove the parchment paper. Slice the cake and serve topped with freshly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

 inchBrown on Blonde inch Blondies
170 grams unsalted butter
100 grams walnuts
55 grams pecans
272 grams all-purpose flour
6 grams baking powder
3 grams kosher salt
55 grams almond butter
346 grams dark brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Crank the oven to 350ÂºF. Coat the insides of an 8-inch square baking pan with non-stick cooking spray and line with a sling of parchment paper.
Melt the butter in an 8-inch sautÃ© pan over medium heat. When it's done bubbling, add the walnuts and pecans and cook until the nuts are toasted and the butter smells nutty, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
Place a fine-mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl and strain the butter away from the nuts. Set both aside to cool for 30 minutes. Then, chop the nuts coarsely and set aside.
While you're waiting, beat the almond butter into the cooled butter, followed by the brown sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Beat until completely smooth, about 1 minute, then stir in the flour mixture. Finish by folding in the nuts and transferring to the prepared pan. The batter will be thick, so I suggest a rubber or silicone spatula.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the edges are deeply brown and the top is dry and cracked. Remove from the pan and cool on a rack for about 30 minutes. Slice into squares and devour with plenty of frosty almond milk.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and salt on a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper and set aside.
Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until fluffy. Stop to add the sugar; then beat on medium speed until well incorporated.
Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly after each addition. Mix in the pumpkin puree and honey. Reduce the speed to low. Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the hot water, beating until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by one third of the hot water. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining hot water, and mix slowly until just combined. Take care not to overmix the batter so the cupcakes will bake up light and fluffy.
Use a standard-size ice-cream scoop to fill each baking cup with batter, so the wells are two-thirds full. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes (start checking at 20 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
Place all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until well combined. Be sure to beat on high speed for at least two minutes at the end to ensure that the frosting is light and fluffy.
Line up cooled cupcakes on a sheet of wax paper. Transfer the maple cream-cheese frosting into a plastic piping bag fitted with a large round metal tip (or piping tip of your choice). Apply a signature swirl.
Break white fondant into three equal pieces. Add a small drop of red food color to one piece of fondant, a small drop of yellow food color to the second piece of fondant, and a small drop of brown food color to the third piece of fondant. Using your hands, knead the color into each piece of fondant so the color is uniform throughout. If youâd like the colors to be darker or more intense, add more food color and repeat. Then, starting with one piece of fondant, use a rolling pin to roll the fondant out to a thin sheet. Dust with edible luster dust (optional). Using a mini leaf cookie cutter, cut out leaf shapes and place on top of each cupcake.

1 pound milk, semisweet, and/or bittersweet chocolate (preferably 40â60% cacao), chopped
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon coconut or other neutral vegetable oil
A candy thermometer

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 13x9 inch baking pan, line bottom and sides with parchment paper, and butter parchment.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat 1 cup butter in a large bowl until creamy. Add sugar and beat, scraping bowl occasionally, until incorporated. Beat in salt, then vanilla. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually beat in flour, scraping bowl occasionally, until dough just starts to form and large pieces of flour remain.
Press dough into prepared pan in an even layer. Poke holes all over with a fork. Bake cookie until golden brown and firm to the touch, 30â35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
Heat cream, butter, and salt in a heatproof measuring cup or bowl in a microwave until cream is warm and butter is melted, about 45 seconds.
Gently stir sugar and 1/3 cup water in a large saucepan. Heat over medium and cook, brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush if needed and swirling pan gently (do not stir), until sugar is amber-brown, 15â20 minutes. Remove from heat.
Carefully add cream mixture in a steady stream, stirring with a silicone spatula (it will bubble up violently); if it looks like it may boil over, stop adding cream mixture and stir to break up bubbles.
Fit saucepan with candy thermometer and heat over medium. Cook, undisturbed, until mixture reaches 245 degrees F (almost firm-ball stage). Immediately and carefully pour over cookie. Tilt pan to spread caramel evenly. Let sit until set, at least 1 hour and up to overnight.
Heat chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (bowl should not touch water), stirring, until melted. Remove from heat and, stirring constantly, add oil. Let cool, stirring occasionally, until chocolate firms slightly, about 10 minutes.
Place a sheet of parchment paper over cake pan. Place cutting board over parchment. Holding pan and board, invert quickly. Lift off pan, then peel off parchment.
Pour one-third of chocolate mixture over cookie; reserve remaining chocolate mixture at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Spread chocolate mixture evenly with an offset spatula until cookie is coated. Chill until set, about 15 minutes.
Using an oiled knife, cut cookie in half lengthwise. Carefully invert bars, caramel side up, and transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet lined with waxed paper, spacing 2 inch apart.
Slowly pour reserved chocolate mixture over bars; coat tops completely and let run down sides (use an offset spatula to coat sides completely if needed). If you run out of chocolate mixture, carefully lift rack off pan, then remove waxed paper with chocolate drippings. Return rack to pan and pour chocolate drippings over. Create a swoopy texture in chocolate with offset spatula, if desired. Chill until firm, about 45 minutes.
Let sit at room temperature 10 minutes, then slice each bar crosswise into 10â12 pieces.
Cookie bars can be made 3 days ahead; loosely cover and chill.

No-Bake Butterscotch-Coconut Cookies
3/4 cup butterscotch chips
3/4 cup creamy no-stir peanut butter
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 1/4 cups unsweetened shredded coconut, divided
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces dark chocolate (optional)

Heat butterscotch chips and peanut butter in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until butterscotch is melted and smooth. Add oats, 1 cup coconut, and salt; stir gently to combine.
Spoon mixture by the tablespoonful onto a parchment-lined sheet tray. Gently press balls in the center to flatten. Chill until set, about 10 minutes.
Heat chocolate, if using, in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Drizzle cooled cookies with chocolate, top with remaining 1/4 cup coconut, and chill until set, about 5 minutes, before serving.
Cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill.

Chewy CoconutâChocolate Chip Cookies
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 large egg, at room temperature, plus 1 egg yolk
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, coconut, baking soda, and salt.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium-high speed fluffy and yellow.
Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition for 30 seconds.
Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the flour mixture in three parts, beating for about 10 seconds after each addition. Add the chocolate chips and mix until just combined.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Scoop out portions of dough the size of golf balls, roll them between your palms loosely, and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheet (youâll need to bake the cookies in several batches). Bake for 14 minutes, or until the cookies are set around the edges. Halfway through baking, remove the pan from the oven and drop it onto a heat-safe flat surface, such as the open oven door (this deflates the cookies, creating a deliciously chewy center and crisp edgesâin other words . . . perfect!). Immediately return the cookies to the oven, rotating the pan 180 degrees, and complete baking, until the center resists light pressure but is still somewhat soft.
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat to make the rest of the cookies.
To store extra dough and make future cookie baking a breeze, roll out balls and freeze them on a cookie sheet. Once theyâre set, transfer them to a resealable freezer bag or airtight container and keep them frozen for up to 3 months. Let the dough balls sit out at room temperature for 15 minutes before baking as usual.

Pannelet Cookies with Sweet Potato and Coconut
1 cup (8 ounces) mashed or purÃ©ed baked orange-fleshed yam (see Cooks' Note), such as jewel or garnet
2 cups (6 ounces) unsweetened dried shredded coconut, toasted (see Cooks' Note)
1 1/3 cups (9.3 ounces) sugar
2 large egg whites
3/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 cup (5 ounces) whole almonds, with or without skin
Sugar or Cardamom Sugar (see below) or turbinado sugar for rolling
Cookie sheets, lined with parchment paper or greased; food processor

In a medium bowl, whisk the yam, toasted coconut, sugar, egg whites, salt, and lemon zest together.
In a food processor, pulse the almonds to an uneven meal ranging in texture from very fine (mostly) to finely chopped. Stir the almonds into the batter. The dough will be very soft and sticky. Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days to allow the coconut to absorb moisture from the yams.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Scoop level tablespoons of the soft dough and roll into balls about 1 1/4 inches. Roll the balls in sugar (or, if using turbinado sugar roll only the top half of each ball in sugar to avoid oversweetening). Place 1 1/2 inches apart on the lined or greased cookie sheets.
Bake for 18 to 24 minutes, until the cookies are slightly crusty on the surface (though still very tender and moist inside) and deep golden brown on the bottom. Rotate the pans from top to bottom and from front to back halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking. For lined pans, set the pans or just the liners on racks to cool; for unlined pans, use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to racks. Cool the cookies completely before storing. May be kept in an airtight container for up to 4 or 5 days.
Cardamom Pannelets: Omit the lemon zest. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom, 2 teaspoons grated orange zest, and 2 teaspoons orange flower water to the yam mixture.
Masala Pannelets: A little Spanish/Asian fusion cookie and very good. Omit the lemon zest. Add 2 teaspoons garam masala to the yam mixture. Roll in plain sugar or cinnamon sugar.

Soft Oatmeal Cookies
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup dark sultanas or golden raisins
1/4 cup dried currants
1 1/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Large pinch of kosher salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups rolled oats
A stand or handheld electric mixer
Parchment paper

Combine the raisins, sultanas, and currants in a bowl, add enough water to cover, and let them soak in the fridge for at least 5 hours or overnight. Drain and discard the water.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. line a large cookie sheet or baking sheet with parchment paper.
Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (You can use a handheld electric mixer instead, if you fancy.) Mix on high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Youâll occasionally need to scrape down the butter and sugar that clings to the sides. Crack in one egg and beat for 30 seconds, then add the other egg and beat for 30 seconds more.
Sift the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a medium bowl and stir well. add to the egg mixture, along with the vanilla extract, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and mix at medium speed just until the ingredients are well mixed and the flour is evenly distributed. add the oats, raisins, sultanas, and currants and mix just until theyâre evenly distributed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and pop it in the fridge to chill, at least an hour.
Use your hands to divide the dough into 16 equal balls (about 2 1/2 tablespoons each) and place half on the lined sheet, leaving about 2 inches between them. Bake for about 20 minutes, rotating the pan after about 10 minutes, just until they go golden brown all over and firm at the edges and no longer feel sticky or gooey when you touch one with your finger. Let the cookies cool on a rack as you bake the second batch.
Eat the cookies slightly warm, when theyâre cakey, or when theyâve cooled completely.

1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
1 1/2 cups chilled heavy cream
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)
Two 9 inch-diameter cake pans with 2 inch-high sides; a 9 inch-diameter springform pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment-paper rounds; coat paper. Place cocoa powder and chocolate in a medium metal bowl. Pour hot coffee over. Let stand for 1 minute. Stir until smooth. Stir in buttermilk and vanilla; set aside.
Whisk cake flour and next 3 ingredients in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl. Beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with chocolate mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Divide batter evenly between pans; smooth tops.
Bake cakes until a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to wire racks; let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes (cakes will deflate slightly). Run a knife around pans to loosen cakes; invert cakes onto racks. Peel off paper and let cakes cool completely. Turn cakes over.
If needed, use a long serrated knife to cut off bumps or trim dome from top of each cake to create a flat, even surface.
Place chocolate and salt in a medium bowl. Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium deep saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and cook without stirring, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush, until sugar is deep amber, about 9 minutes. Remove from heat and gradually add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir over medium heat until caramel bits dissolve. Pour over chocolate in bowl. Add vanilla; stir until mixture is smooth. Let cool slightly.
Place 1 cake layer in springform pan. Pour 1 cup ganache over. Chill until set, about 30 minutes. Cover remaining ganache and let stand at room temperature.
Place 2 tablespoons cold water in a small heatproof glass or metal bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes.
Pour water to a depth of 1/2 inch into a small skillet set over medium heat. Transfer bowl with gelatin to skillet; stir until gelatin dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove bowl from skillet. Set aside.
Place cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Using an electric mixer, beat cream until soft peaks form. Add gelatin; beat filling until firm peaks form.
Spoon filling over chilled ganache on cake layer in pan; smooth top. Gently place second cake layer on top. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and chill until cream layer is set, at least 6 hours or overnight.
Remove sides from springform pan. Using a knife or offset spatula, scrape off any filling that may have leaked out from between cakes to form smooth sides. Transfer cake to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet.
Rewarm remaining ganache until just pourable. (Microwave in a microwave-safe bowl, or set a metal bowl over a large saucepan of simmering water until just warm, not hot.) Pour ganache over cake, tilting cake as needed to allow ganache to drip down sides and using an offset spatula to help spread ganache, if needed, to cover sides of cake. Chill until ganache is set, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Cake can be made 2 days ahead. Cover with a cake dome; chill. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.
Sprinkle cake with flaky sea salt.

Transfer bowl to stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed with the whisk attachment until mixture is cooled and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes (when you lift the whisk, mixture should fall back on itself in thick ribbons).
Transfer melted butter to a medium bowl. Add thyme, vanilla, and 1 cup egg mixture to butter and whisk to combine.
Transfer remaining egg mixture to a large wide bowl. Sift half of the flour over egg mixture. Using a rubber spatula or large balloon whisk, fold flour gently into egg mixture until almost fully incorporated. Repeat with the remaining flour, then fold in butter mixture with spatula just until incorporated. Gently divide batter between prepared pans; smooth surface.
Bake cakes until tops are deep golden and centers spring back when pressed lightly, 25â30 minutes. Immediately run a knife around edges and remove springform. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool completely.
Bring sugar, thyme, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Let sit until cool, about 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring cup and chill until ready to use.
Using a serrated knife, trim top of each cake to make them flat. Brush tops with 2â3 Tbsp. syrup per cake, depending on how concentrated you'd like the thyme flavor to be.
Toss 10 oz. strawberries with1 Tbsp. syrup in a medium bowl and let sit at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, whip heavy cream to soft peaks in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add sour cream and 2 Tbsp. syrup and whip to stiff peaks.
Transfer 1 cake layer to a platter and top with syrup-macerated strawberries. Top with half of the whipped cream, then place second cake layer gently on the first. Top with remaining whipped cream. Chill to set, at least 1 hour. Just before serving, arrange remaining 6 oz. strawberries, baby strawberries, if using, and thyme over cake.
Cakes can be baked and syrup-soaked, but not assembled, 2 days ahead; wrap layers separately in plastic and chill. Thyme syrup can be made 5 days ahead; chill in a resealable container. Assembled cake can be made 12 hours ahead; chill.

1 1/2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1 3/4 cups cake flour, plus more for pan
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup virgin coconut oil, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups canned unsweetened coconut milk, divided
1 1/2 cups sugar
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon finely grated key lime zest
1/3 cup fresh key lime juice (from about 6 key limes)
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature
3 large egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon finely grated key lime zest
1/4 cup fresh key lime juice (from about 4 key limes)
1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream
1 teaspoon finely grated key lime zest
1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes

Position rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Spread coconut in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden brown and aromatic, 3â5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, coat a 13x9 inch pan with nonstick spray. Dust with flour, tapping out any excess.
Whisk toasted coconut, baking powder, salt, and 1 3/4 cups flour in a medium bowl. Mix coconut oil, vanilla, and 2/3 cup coconut milk in another medium bowl.
Cream sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until pale and fluffy, 3â4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with coconut milk mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing top with a spatula.
Bake cake until top is set and golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25â30 minutes.
Mix key lime zest, juice, and remaining 2/3 cup coconut milk in a small bowl (it's okay if mixture separates slightly; it will be absorbed by cake). Using a skewer, poke holes every 2 inch into warm cake. Slowly pour key lime zest mixture over cake. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool completely.
Pour water into a medium pot to a depth of 2 inch. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Place butter in a large bowl.
Whisk egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof medium bowl. Whisk in key lime zest and juice. Set bowl on saucepan, making sure bottom does not touch water. Cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and an instant-read thermometer registers 175 degrees F, 3â4 minutes.
Strain egg yolk mixture through a fine-mesh sieve over butter, then stir with a rubber spatula until smooth. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on key lime curd and chill at least 30 minutes.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat cream in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in chilled key lime curd and key lime zest. Spread cream on cooled cake with a spatula, then chill 30 minutes to set cream.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread coconut flakes in a single layer on rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing halfway through, until crispy and golden, 5â7 minutes. Let cool.
When ready to serve, sprinkle toasted coconut flakes over cake.
Lime curd can be made 1 week ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill, or freeze up to 4 months.

BÃ»che de NoÃ«l
6 large egg whites
1 1/4 cups sugar
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting)
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1 inch pieces, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting
1/4 cup whole milk
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 large eggs, room temperature
3 large egg yolks, room temperature
3/4 cup sugar
Cocoa Syrup
Bittersweet Ganache
Mascarpone Filling
1 ounce marzipan (about 2 tablespoons)
2 tablespoons dark unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-process
1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, melted

Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Whisk egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water) until egg whites are very liquid (mixture will be warm to the touch) and sugar is dissolved (rub between your fingers to check), about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat and beat with an electric mixer until stiff, glossy peaks form (bowl will feel cool), about 5 minutes.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and dust very lightly with cocoa powder. Scoop out 1 cup meringue. Dollop heaping teaspoonfuls of meringue onto prepared baking sheet, spacing at least 1 1/2 inch apart.
Lightly dust meringue with more cocoa powder and place a sheet of parchment over top. Use an offset spatula or your hands to flatten meringue into irregularly shaped disks about 1/8 inch thick. Bake until lightly browned and parchment peels away easily, 75â90 minutes (meringue will be soft when it first comes out of the oven but will dry and crisp as it cools).
Meanwhile, with mixer on medium speed, beat butter into remaining meringue, adding a piece at a time and waiting until incorporated before adding more. Beat until mixture is very smooth. (If it looks very loose or curdled, just keep beating; buttercream will come back together.) Add vanilla extract and scrape in vanilla seeds; beat to combine.
Mushrooms and buttercream can be made 2 days ahead. Store mushrooms airtight at room temperature. Cover and chill buttercream; bring to room temperature, then beat until smooth before using.
Increase oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 26x18 inch rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Spray parchment. Whisk flour, cornstarch, and â cup cocoa powder in a small bowl.
Bring milk, butter, oil, vanilla, and salt to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Keep warm over low heat.
Meanwhile, beat eggs and egg yolks with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Increase speed to high; beat until doubled in volume. With motor running, gradually add sugar; beat until very light and fluffy and mixture falls back on itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon (it should be at least quadrupled in volume), about 5 minutes.
Reduce speed to medium and gradually stream in milk mixture. Sift one-third of dry ingredients over top; gently fold in until only a few streaks remain. Working in 2 additions, repeat with remaining dry ingredients, scraping bottom of bowl and using as few strokes as possible to keep eggs from deflating (a few streaks are fine). Scrape batter into prepared baking sheet and gently spread to edges of pan. Tap sheet lightly on counter to pop any large air bubbles.
Bake cake until surface is puffed and springy to the touch, 10â12 minutes.
Let cake cool in pan 2 minutes, then run a knife along short edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack and carefully peel away parchment. Using a fine-mesh sieve, dust cake with cocoa powder. Cover with a large kitchen towel. Place another wire rack on top and flip cake over so towel side is underneath. Remove top rack; dust exposed side with cocoa powder. Starting at one of the long sides, gently roll up warm cake inside towel. Let cake cool, seam side down, 30â35 minutes.
Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped in plastic at room temperature.
Carefully unroll towel and cake on a flat surface (cake will curl at the ends and may have a few small cracks but should stay in 1 piece). Position cake so the end that was in innermost part of spiral is closest to you; brush off any excess cocoa.
Using a pastry brush, gently dab cocoa syrup over entire surface of cake; you may not use it all. Dollop bittersweet ganache over top and smooth with an offset spatula to create an even layer.
Dollop mascarpone filling over ganache; carefully spread over surface, trying not to blend with ganache and avoiding last inch of cake along long side farthest from you.
Using towel to lift edge nearest you, reroll cake, keeping towel on exterior. Chill, seam side down, until filling is set, about 30 minutes.
Transfer filled cake to a baking sheet. Set aside 1/2 cup buttercream for attaching branches. Evenly spread remaining buttercream over cake with an offset spatula.
Using a long serrated knife, trim 1/2 inch of cake from each end to create clean edges; discard (or eat!). Slice off a 4 inch piece of cake. Starting 1 inch from end, divide 4 inch piece in half, cutting at a 45 degrees  angle, leaving 1 inch at opposite end. Transfer log to a platter.
Place angled side of each small piece of cake against roll to create branches, positioning one on top and the other on the side using a large dab of buttercream to secure. Cover any exposed cake on sides with more buttercream but leave cut ends exposed.
Use spatula to create textured lines in buttercream to look like birch bark.
Knead together marzipan and cocoa powder on a surface until smooth. Roll out on a sheet of parchment paper to less than 1/8 inch thick, then cut out wavy strips to look like tree knots; drape over buttercream and press gently to adhere.
Using either a pastry bag fitted with a very small round tip or a disposable plastic bag with one corner snipped off, drizzle melted chocolate over log to mimic birch bark striations. Chill BÃ»che de NoÃ«l, uncovered, until ready to serve.
Just before serving, press mushrooms perpendicularly into log in groups of 2 or 3.
BÃ»che de NoÃ«l (without meringue mushrooms) can be assembled 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and chill. Attach mushrooms just before serving.

Transfer butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; add sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until pale and well combined, about 2 minutes. Add egg and beat until combined, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add dry ingredients and pistachios and beat on low speed just until combined.
Turn out dough onto a clean work surface. Divide in half. Place each half on a 9x13 inch sheet of parchment paper with the long end facing you. Roll dough into 2 logs about 1 1/2 inch in diameter. Wrap each in parchment paper, making sure to cover ends completely. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
Position racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Let dough stand at room temperature until soft enough to slice, about 15 minutes. Slice logs into 1/4 inch-thick rounds. Arrange rounds on 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until bottoms are lightly golden, 12â15 minutes. Transfer sheets to wire racks and let cool.
Combine chocolate and oil in a small heatproof bowl. Heat in 10-second intervals in microwave, stirring, until melted and combined, 30â40 seconds total.
Dip cookies halfway into melted chocolate and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets. Sprinkle chocolate with pistachios. Chill until chocolate is set, about 10 minutes.
Dough can be made up to 2 weeks ahead; keep frozen. Let stand at room temperature until soft enough to slice, about 30 minutes.

Black and White Sesame Seed Cookies
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3 cups cake flour, plus more
1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup black sesame seeds
1/4 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup white sesame seeds
4 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
Pinch of kosher salt
A 3 inch-diameter cookie cutter

Whisk baking powder, salt, and 3 cups cake flour in a small bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter and sugar in a medium bowl until well combined (butter does not need to be fluffy), about 3 minutes. Add egg and egg yolk and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix in dry ingredients. Divide dough in half and form into 3/4 inch-thick disks. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, about 2 hours.
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, shifting often on sheet and dusting with more flour as needed to keep from sticking, until about 1/4 inch thick. Punch out rounds with cookie cutter and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 1/2 inch apart. Pat scraps into a 3/4 inch-thick disk. Chill 15 minutes.
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 12-15 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool. Cut out and bake scraps, then repeat process with remaining disk of dough.
Dough can be made 1 month ahead; freeze. Cookies can be baked 2 weeks ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Thaw before decorating. Frosting and Assembly Toss black sesame seeds and oil in a medium shallow bowl to coat seeds (this will keep them jet-black and shiny). Place white sesame seeds in another medium shallow bowl.
Whisk powdered sugar, lemon juice, salt, and 1/3 cup water in a large bowl until smooth. Place half of the icing in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/8 inch tip. (Or use a large resealable plastic bag and cut a small opening in 1 corner.)
Working with 1 cookie at a time, pipe down center and then around the edge of half of the cookie to create a semicircle. Pipe icing inside border to fill, then use a small offset spatula to evenly spread over half of the cookie. Working quickly so icing is still wet, dip frosted part of cookie into white sesame seeds, patting gently to adhere, then letting excess fall back into bowl. Let sit 15 minutes for icing to set.
Repeat process on the other half of the cookie, dipping into black sesame seeds, and let sit at least 20 minutes before serving
Cookies can be frosted and decorated 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Ombre Rainbow Cookies
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 1/2 cups sugar
10 ounces almond paste (about 1 cup), crumbled
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
6 large eggs, room temperature
3 cups all-purpose flour
5 3/4 teaspoons plus 4 drops green or red food coloring, divided
5 teaspoons matcha (green tea powder) or 1 ounce (about 1 cup) freeze-dried raspberries, divided
3/4 cup apricot jam, divided

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat three 13x9 inch baking dishes with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on both long sides. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter, sugar, almond paste, oil, and salt in a large bowl until mixture is well combined and fluffy, 5â8 minutes.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition to incorporate before adding the next. Continue to beat mixture until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and, with motor running, gradually add flour. Continue mixing just until combined. Divide batter evenly among 3 bowls. (Scoop out about 2 1/4 cups per bowl, or weigh out 500 g/1 lb. 2 oz. batter for each.)
If making matcha cookies, mix 4 drops green food coloring and 1/2 tsp. matcha into batter in first bowl. Mix 3/4 tsp. green food coloring and 1 1/2 tsp. matcha to batter in second bowl. Mix 5 tsp. green food coloring and 3 tsp. matcha into batter in last bowl. (This will create three shades of green batter.)
If making raspberry cookies, pulse raspberries in a food processor to create a fine powder. Mix 4 drops red food coloring and 1 1/2 tsp. raspberry powder to batter in first bowl. Mix 3/4 tsp. red food coloring and 1 Tbsp. plus 1 1/2 tsp. raspberry powder into batter in second bowl. Mix 5 tsp. red food coloring and 2 Tbsp. raspberry powder into last bowl of batter. (This will create three shades of red/pink batter.)
Scrape a bowl of batter into each prepared pan and smooth tops. Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until center springs back when gently pressed, 12â15 minutes. Let cakes cool completely in pans.
Remove lightest-colored cake from pan, turning out onto a surface, and carefully peel away parchment paper. Spread half of jam evenly over top. Remove medium-colored cake from pan, peel away parchment paper, and place on top of light cake. Spread evenly with remaining jam. Remove darkest-colored cake from its pan, peel away parchment paper, and place on top. Press down gently to adhere layers and wrap tightly in plastic; chill at least 1 hour.
To make cookies, trim edges to square off; about 1/2 inch on each side should do it. Then, using a serrated knife, cut cake crosswise into 1 1/2 inch-wide strips (you should have 8 total). Cut strips crosswise into 3/4 inch-thick pieces.
Cakes can be assembled 5 days ahead; wrap tightly and keep chilled. Cut into pieces just before serving.

Double Ginger Sticky Toffee Pudding
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
10 ounces Medjool dates, chopped (about 2 cups)
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger
3 large eggs, room temperature
1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger
1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Demerara sugar (for serving)
A 9-cup Bundt pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly butter and flour pan, making sure to get into all curved or detailed places. Toss dates and baking soda in a small bowl to coat, then pour in 1 cup boiling water. Let mixture sit until dates are very soft, 10â15 minutes. Mash dates lightly with a fork (mixture will be thick but not smooth and homogenous).
While dates are soaking, whisk baking powder, salt, and remaining 2 cups flour in a medium bowl.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat brown sugar, fresh ginger, and remaining 1/2 cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition before adding the next. Then alternating, add dry ingredients and date mixture in 2 additions each, starting with dry ingredients and ending with date mixture. Fold in crystallized ginger. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface.
Bake cake until top is firm and springs back when gently pressed with your fingers and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35â45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes before turning out onto rack, then let cool another 20 minutes (cake should still be warm).
Bring brown sugar, cream, butter, salt, and 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring to melt butter. Cook, stirring, until mixture is thick enough to coat a spoon, 5â8 minutes. Let cool slightly.
Poke holes all over warm cake with a toothpick. Wipe out Bundt pan; pour a third of sauce into pan. Carefully invert cake back into pan. Poke holes in bottom of cake and pour more sauce over. Let sit until cake absorbs sauce, 15â20 minutes.
Turn cake out onto rack (it may not come out at first but will eventually release) and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Serve cake with remaining toffee sauce. If the sauce has cooled by the time you're ready to serve, gently reheat just to warm through.
Cake can be made 1 day ahead; store tightly covered at room temperature. Cover and chill leftover sauce. Gently reheat before serving.

Apple Jack Stack Cake
3 pounds assorted apples, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch wedges
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup apple cider
1/4 cup applejack, apple brandy, or bourbon
1 1/2 cups apple butter
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
2 cups granulated sugar
1/4 cup molasses
2 large eggs
1 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup reserved apple cider mixture (from the filling)
1 tablespoon molasses
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Put the apples, brown sugar, cider, and applejack in a large saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the apples and reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid. Set aside.
Position the racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two baking sheets with cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. In a large liquid measuring cup, whisk together the buttermilk and vanilla.
In large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the molasses, beating until incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until incorporated. Gradually add the buttermilk (the mixture will look curdled); add the flour mixture and mix until a soft dough formsâit should look like cookie dough. Remove the dough from the bowl, pat into a round, cover in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Divide the dough into 6 equal portions, about 8 1/2 ounces each. On parchment paper, roll portions of dough into circles about 1/4 inch thick. Use an 8-inch cake pan as a guide to trim into uniform 8-inch circles. Bake one circle on each prepared sheet until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating and switching the baking sheets halfway through baking. Transfer the circles to cooling racks and let cool completely. The cakes will harden and set as they cool. Repeat with remaining dough. Reroll scraps to form a seventh layer.
Place the first layer on a serving plate and spread with 1/4 cup of the apple butter. Arrange one-sixth of the cooled cooked apples on top of apple butter and top with another layer of cake. Repeat with the remaining filling and cake layers, ending with a cake layer on top. Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the layers soften, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.
In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, reserved apple cider mixture, and the molasses. Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat and cook until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes, then pour the glaze over the top of the cake. Slice and serve, or store the cake, covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Cook orange juice, 1/4 cup pomegranate molasses, 1/4 cup sugar, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is slightly reduced, about 4 minutes. Add pears, cut side up, and cook (undisturbed) until they begin to release their juices, about 3 minutes. Turn pears over and cook just until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Let cool slightly, then arrange pears, cut side down, in prepared pan.
Return skillet to medium heat and cook liquid in skillet until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes, depending on juiciness of pears. Pour syrup over pears and freeze while you prepare the batter (this is to allow syrup to set upâdon't let it freeze solid).
Pulse walnuts and remaining 1 1/2 cups flour in food processor until walnuts are finely ground. Pulse in baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cardamom.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat eggs, orange zest, and remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar in a medium bowl until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Fold in dry ingredients in 2 additions, fully incorporating before adding the next addition, then gradually mix in oil. Pour batter over pears and smooth top.

Peach-Blackberry Camp Cake
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
4 peaches, halved, pitted
2 tablespoons bourbon
Pinch of kosher salt
6 tablespoons demerara or dark brown sugar, divided
Vegetable oil (for foil)
1 large egg
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
6 ounces blackberries (about 1 cup)
1/3 cup coarsely chopped unsalted, roasted almonds
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
7-quart. Dutch oven or other large cast-iron Dutch oven with a flanged lid

Whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; transfer to a large resealable plastic bag.
Cake mix can be made 1 week ahead. Store at room temperature.
Build a fire in a pit and let it burn down until coals are covered with ash. Rake a layer of coals away to one side of fire. Toss peaches, bourbon, salt, 2 tablespoons demerara sugar, and 2 tablespoons water on a 20x12 inch sheet of heavy-duty foil, then fold edges up and over to create a packet; pinch edges closed. Cook on a grate over coals, adding a splash or two of water halfway through if needed, until soft, 20â30 minutes. Let peaches cool slightly; coarsely chop.
Line a Dutch oven with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil; lightly oil foil. Combine egg, buttermilk, and vanilla in a measuring glass or small bowl. Place cake mix in a large bowl and vigorously stir in butter and 1/4 cup buttermilk mixture, adding a bit more buttermilk mixture if needed, until a very thick paste forms. Stir in remaining buttermilk mixture, then add blackberries and peaches along with any juices and gently fold in just until mixture looks marbled. Scrape batter into Dutch oven; top with almonds and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons demerara sugar. Cover.
Place Dutch oven directly in coals and set 18 hot briquettes (or scoop about a 1 inch layer of fine coals) on top of lid. Bake, rotating lid every 10 minutes (for even baking) and replenishing coals as needed, until cake is firm to the touch when gently pressed, 25â30 minutes.
Just before serving, place yogurt in a small bowl and sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons demerara sugar over top. Let sit until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Serve warm cake upside down and dolloped with yogurt.

Pan Cake
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/8 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon finely ground coffee beans (optional)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, baking soda, and ground coffee beans (if using) in an ungreased 8-or 9-inch round cake pan and stir with a whisk. Make a crater, pour in the remaining ingredients and 1 cup water, and whisk until all the corners are gotten and the batter is smooth. Put in the oven and start checking for doneness in 20 minutes; the cake should be done at around 30 minutes.
Vanilla ice cream really helps pan cake, and so does chocolate whipped cream frosting. Start with 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate, chopped or chips, and 1 pint whipping cream. Put all the chocolate and about 1/2 cup of the cream in a medium mixing bowl and heat over simmering water until the chocolate has melted. Remove from the heat and whisk in the rest of the cream and 1 or 2 teaspoons sugar. Refrigerate until well chilled and then whip until thick and smooth. Be sure the cake is completely cooled before spreading on. If it's a warm day and you're not eating the cake right away, refrigerate it or the chocolate cream will melt right off.

Flourless Apple, Almond, and Ginger Cake
3 Granny Smith apples
30 g (1 ounce) unsalted butter
50 g (1 3/4 ounces/1/4 cup) caster (superfine) sugar
2 whole cloves
80 g (1/2 cup) raisins
260 g (9 1/4 ounces/2 1/3 cups) ground almonds
220 g (1 1/2 cups) whole almonds
2 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons baking powder
4 eggs
230 g (8 1/2 ounces/1 cup) raw (demerara) sugar
145 ml (1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon) pure maple or golden syrup (light treacle)
2 royal gala or golden delicious apples
50 g (1/3 cup) whole almonds, coarsely chopped
50 g (1 3/4 ounces) butter, melted
50 g (1/4 cup) raw (demerara) sugar

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F/Gas 4). Grease and line a 26 cm (10 1/2 inch) springform cake tin.
Peel and core the apples, then cut into wedges.
Over medium heat, melt the butter in a frying pan large enough to fit the apples in one layer. Add the apple wedges, caster sugar and cloves and toss to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are well coated, soft and starting to colour, about 5â10 minutes. There should be no liquid left in the pan. Remove the cloves, add the raisins and cook for another minute or so to soften. Remove from the heat and cool.
Process the ground almonds, whole almonds, ginger and baking powder in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Set aside.
In an electric mixer, whisk the eggs, raw sugar and maple or golden syrup until light and fluffy. Fold in the nut mixture and cooked apples. Pour into the prepared tin.
To make the topping, core and thinly slice the apples and arrange over the cake batter, overlapping slightly. Scatter the almonds on top, pour the melted butter over and then sprinkle on the sugar.
Bake the cake for about 1â1 1/4 hours until golden and cooked through and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover with some foil.
Cool completely in the tin and serve at room temperature with plain yoghurt or vanilla ice cream.

Chocolate Plum Cake
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for pan
1 pound ripe or very ripe plums, coarsely chopped
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate (70â72% cacao), coarsely chopped
5 large eggs, room temperature
1 1/2 cups sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream
Unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting)
A 9-inch-diameter springform pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter bottom and sides of springform pan and line bottom with parchment.
PurÃ©e plums in a blender until very smooth (you need 1 1/2 cups; reserve any additional purÃ©e for another use). If plums are not ripe enough to form a very smooth purÃ©e, strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
Combine chocolate and 3/4 cup butter in a large heatproof bowl. Set bowl over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water). Stir until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove bowl from saucepan. Stir plum purÃ©e into chocolate mixture until well combined.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat eggs and sugar in another large bowl until pale and tripled in volume, 10â12 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold about 1/3 of the egg mixture into chocolate mixture to lighten, then fold chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture until combined.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl, then fold dry ingredients into chocolate mixture until combined.
Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth surface. Bake cake until center is set and sides are beginning to brown, 45â55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool completely in pan (cake will sink a little in the center as it cools).
Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Unmold cake (run a knife around the edge to help release, if needed) and transfer to a platter. Mound whipped cream in center of cake, then dust with cocoa powder.

Banana Split Ice Cream Cake
2 (9-ounce) packages chocolate wafer cookies
1 cup virgin coconut oil, melted
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup sugar
4 large ripe bananas (about 1 1/2 pounds), cut into 2 inch pieces
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
5 pints vanilla ice cream, softened at room temperature 10 minutes, divided
1 3/4 cups maraschino cherries (from two 10-ounce jars), drained, patted dry, stems removed, plus more with stems for serving
2 1/4 teaspoons powdered unflavored gelatin (from one 1/4-ounce envelope)
1/2 cup sugar
3 cups heavy cream
1/3 cup salted, roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
A 9 inch springform pan

Pulse cookies in a food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and add coconut oil and salt. Mix with your hands until crumbs are coated in oil and mixture resembles wet sand.
Press 2 cups cookie crumbs into the bottom of springform pan and freeze until ready to use. Spread out remaining crumbs on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer (do not press). Freeze crumbs on baking sheet 30 minutes, then crumble into very small pieces with your hands. Freeze until ready to use.
Bring sugar and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, until caramel is a deep amber color, 8â10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add bananas a few pieces at a time, stirring between additions. Add cream and salt and cook, stirring often, until bananas are almost entirely broken down (only a few chunks should remain), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool.
Mix 2 1/2 pints ice cream in a large bowl with a wooden spoon until it resembles thick cake batter (it should be soft but not melted). Fold in 1 1/2 cups cookie crumble with a rubber spatula and scrape into pan with cookie crust; smooth top. Sprinkle 1 cup cookie crumble over ice cream, pressing lightly to adhere. Working quickly, scrape caramel-banana jam over cookie crumble and spread evenly. Top caramel with 1 cup cookie crumble. Freeze 20 minutes.
Mix remaining 2 1/2 pints ice cream in the same bowl to cake-batter consistency. Fold in 1 3/4 cups cherries. Scrape into pan over cookie crumble and smooth top (it may come up over the edge of the pan). Top with remaining cookie crumble. Freeze cake until frozen, about 3 hours (or overnight).
Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Let sit 5 minutes to soften. Add sugar and bring to a bare simmer, stirring to dissolve gelatin and sugar. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a large bowl and whisk in cream. Beat to medium peaks.
Unmold cake (run a knife around the edge to help release, if needed) and transfer to a platter. Spread threequarters of whipped cream over sides and top of cake. Use remaining whipped cream to create dramatic height, swirling decoratively. Top with nuts and cherries with stems. Freeze cake at least 2 hours before serving. Slice with a warm knife.
Cake can be frosted 1 day ahead; freeze uncovered.

3-Ingredient Japanese Cheesecake
9 ounces white chocolate (about 1 1/2 cups chips or chopped chocolate)
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
6 large eggs, separated, room temperature
A 8 inch round cake pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line bottom of 8 inch cake pan with parchment paper. Cut a 21x5 inch strip of parchment, butter or oil parchment, and line sides of pan. Center the pan on a large piece of foil and fold foil up over the sides to prevent water from entering pan.
Place white chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and heat in microwave in 20-second intervals (or set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water), stirring occasionally, until melted. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in cream cheese. Let cool slightly, then add yolks and stir to combine.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, whip egg whites in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Add a small portion of egg whites to chocolate mixture and stir just until lightened. Gently fold in remaining egg whites in 2 additions until just combined.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Place pan in a baking dish or roasting pan and add warm water to reach halfway up sides of cake pan. Bake cheesecake until set, 40â45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave pan in oven 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Remove cheesecake from pan, transfer to a platter, and chill until cold, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.

Pinch of salt

Whisk granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and 2 cups flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add egg, buttermilk, and butter. Using a wooden spoon or a spatula, gradually incorporate dry ingredients until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a couple of times or so until no wet spots remain (be careful not to overwork or doughnuts will be tough).
Roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick, sprinkling surface and/or dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Punch out as many rounds as you can with 3 1/4 inch cutter, then use 1 1/4 inch cutter to punch out center of each round. Gather doughnut holes and scraps and re-roll; repeat process until all dough has been used (3â4 times; you should have 8 doughnuts).
Fit a medium saucepan with thermometer. Pour in oil to come 4 inch up sides of saucepan and heat over medium until thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Working in batches, fry doughnuts until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack lined with paper towels and let cool slightly.
Whisk together 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon matcha until no lumps remain.
Whisk together 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon matcha until no lumps remain.
Whisk together 1 large egg white, 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons matcha, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon water until smooth.

2 cups/300g cherries
Scant 1/2 cup/50g roughly chopped pistachios, for the topping

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and lightly grease a 9 in/24cm diameter ring cake tin with butter.
Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Pour over the melted butter and mix in the eggs. Spoon the batter into the pre-greased tin and smooth down.
Remove the pits from the cherriesâyou can do this with a cherry pitter or by just pulling them apart and popping the pits out with your fingers. I like to do this over the cake tin, so that any juice drips onto the cake and adds color. Drop the pitted cherries onto the batter and sprinkle the top of the cake with the remaining 1 1/2 tbsp/20g of sugar and the roughly chopped pistachios. Bake in the center of the oven for 25â30 minutes, then turn the cake around and bake for a further 8â10 minutes, until the cake between the cherries goes all golden.
Allow the cake to cool in the tin, as it needs time to settle, then gently remove by running a knife around the edges. Covered well, it will keep in the fridge for up to a week (not much chance of that happening), but for the best flavor, allow it to return to room temperature before eating.

Pecan Praline Thumbprints
1 3/4 cups (6 ounces) toasted, salted pecan pieces
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon sea salt flakes
3/4 cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon sea salt flakes
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 1/4 cups (4 1/2 ounces) toasted, salted pecan pieces

In a food processor, pulse the pecans and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar until a fine meal forms but before the nuts start to release their oils.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter briefly on medium speed for 5 to 10 seconds. Add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and beat together until the butter mixture is aerated and pale in color, approximately 4 minutes. Briefly beat in the vanilla. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to bring the batter together.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour and salts. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the dough comes together but still looks shaggy, approximately 30 seconds. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to bring the batter together. Mix for another 10 seconds on medium speed. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand.
Stretch out a long sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and put the dough on top. Pat into an 8-inch square, using the bench scraper to square off the sides. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until chilled throughout, at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a couple of half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pans with parchment.
Cut the dough into 6 even strips. Roll the strips back and forth into logs to round out the edges. Using the top half of your thumb as a guide, cut each log into 8 pieces but keep the log together. Roll the logs again to round out the edges, then pull the pieces apart and place cut-side up on the prepared pans, evenly spacing up to 20 cookies per pan. With the tip of your index finger, make an indentation into the center of each cookie.
Bake one pan at a time for 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and tap down the centers with the rounded end of a wooden spoon or a cocktail muddler. Rotate the pan and bake until the cookies have slight cracks on the top and are set, another 4 to 6 minutes. When ready, the cookies will have set around the edges and you will be able to gently move them, but they still will be soft. Let the cookies cool completely on the pan. Repeat with the remaining pan.
While the cookies are baking, start the praline. In a pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Mix in the maple syrup, sugars, vanilla, and salts and stir until homogeneous. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil for 3 minutes to thicken. Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine. Let the mixture reduce for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it lightly coats the back of a spoon. Stir in the nuts. You will have approximately 2 1/2 cups of praline.
While the thumbprints are still warm, use a small spoon to scoop the goopy praline into the centers. (It is okay if some spills over on the sides.) Refrigerate until set, approximately 30 minutes.

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
3 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, room temperature
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons coffee liqueur
1 tablespoon sour cream
A 10-inch tube pan

Using your fingers, combine flour, butter, brown sugar, powdered sugar, espresso powder, and salt in a medium bowl until mixture sticks together when pressed. Chill until ready to use.
Melt chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water (water should not touch bowl) or in the top of a double boiler over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in pecans, coffee, and granulated sugar.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour tube pan, tapping out excess flour. Whisk 2 1/2 cups flour, espresso powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and cardamom in a medium bowl. Whisk coffee, sour cream, and vanilla in another medium bowl.
Beat granulated sugar and 1/2 cup butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs and egg yolk one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with coffee mixture in 2 additions, scraping down sides of bowl after each addition.
Scrape one-third of the batter into prepared pan; smooth the surface. Drizzle half of the chocolate swirl mixture over. Add another one-third of the batter; smooth the surface. Drizzle the remaining chocolate swirl mixture over, then scrape in the remaining batter; smooth the surface. Sprinkle crumb topping over. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean and cake springs back when pressed, 40â50 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on a wire rack.
Run a butter knife around the perimeter of pan to loosen cake. Gently invert cake onto a large plate, then return cake (crumb side up) to rack.
When cake is cool, prepare the glaze. Whisk powdered sugar, coffee liqueur, and sour cream in a medium bowl. Using a spoon, drizzle glaze over cooled cake, holding the spoon a few inches above the cake.
Cake can be made up to two days before serving. Store wrapped in plastic until ready to serve.

Absinthe's Golden Yogurt Cake
1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon, Meyer lemon, or orange zest, or a combination
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/8 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
3 eggs
1 1/4 cups sugar
1 cup plain drained yogurt or Greek yogurt (not nonfat)
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup heavy cream, whipped to firm peaks

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch round cake pan with 2-inch sides. Line the bottom with parchment paper and dust the sides with flour, shaking out the excess.
Sift together the flour and baking powder in a bowl.
In a bowl, whisk together the yogurt, oil, zest, vanilla, and salt.
In a stand mixer fitted with a whip, beat the eggs on medium speed until frothy and well blended. Add the sugar gradually. Raise the speed to medium-high and whip until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is thick and pale, stopping the machine to scrape down the sides of the bowl at least once. Lower the mixer speed and add the yogurt mixture gradually. Add the dry ingredients gradually and beat just until well blended.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly. Bake on a center rack until the surface is golden brown and firm to the touch and a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes, and then unmold and finish cooling, top side up, on the rack.
To make the yogurt cream: In a bowl, whisk together the yogurt, honey, and vanilla. Gently fold in the whipped cream.
Slice the cake into wedges to serve, topping each portion with a dollop of the yogurt cream, if desired.

Hibiscus Pavlova with Lemon-Hibiscus Cream
1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons superfine sugar, divided
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
6 tablespoons dried hibiscus flowers (available at natural food stores, Latin or Middle Eastern markets, or online) or 7 hibiscus tea bags
3 large egg whites, room temperature
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar or 3/4 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons dried hibiscus flowers or 2 hibiscus tea bags
1/4 cup superfine sugar
1 cup cold heavy cream
3 tablespoons homemade or store-bought lemon curd
2 tablespoons sour cream
Pinch of fine sea salt

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tsp. superfine sugar, cornstarch, and salt, breaking up any lumps; set aside.
Grind flowers or tea leaves (cut open bags, remove tea, and discard bags) in a spice mill or food processor until very finely ground; set aside.
Using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat egg whites and cream of tartar or vinegar on medium-high speed until the mixture transforms from frothy soapsuds to soft, opaque peaks, about 3 minutes. You should see tracks from the whisk on the surface of the whites.
Add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar slowly, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating to incorporate fully before adding the next spoonful, 5â8 minutes total. Continue to beat on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 2 minutes more. Test to see if sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a small amount between your fingertips. If it still feels gritty, keep beating until dissolved.
Sprinkle the sugar, cornstarch, and salt mixture over egg whites and fold in gently with a spatula. Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift 1 Tbsp. reserved ground tea over mixture and fold in gently. Reserve remaining ground tea.
Using a large spoon, divide meringue into 6 even mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Using the back of the spoon, make a small well in the center of each meringue. Lightly dust 1 tsp. reserved ground tea with fine-mesh strainer over meringues. Reserve remaining ground tea.
Bake, rotating halfway through cooking time, until outsides are dry and a very pale cream color, 65â70 minutes. Turn oven off and leave door slightly ajar with meringues inside, letting them cool completely, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a small pot. Remove from heat and steep dried hibiscus flowers or tea bags, 4â5 minutes. Strain tea or discard tea bags; if straining, strain into a medium bowl, then return tea to pot. Add sugar and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the liquid, stirring occasionally, until a scant 1/4 cup liquid is left, 8â11 minutesâit should be thick with a syrupy consistency. Transfer to a small bowl and chill until cold, about 20 minutes.
Using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat cream on medium-low speed in a large bowl until very soft peaks form. Reduce speed to low and gently beat in lemon curd, sour cream, and salt. If necessary, continue whipping until soft peaks return. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. chilled hibiscus syrup over whipped cream. Using a spatula, marble syrup throughout cream, creating dark pink streaks rather than a solid pink cream.
Divide meringues among 6 dessert plates, then top each with a dollop of lemon-hibiscus cream. Using a fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust top of each pavlova with 1 tsp. reserved ground tea total, if desired, and serve immediately.

3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
2 1/4 cups granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
5 large eggs, room temperature
2 teaspoons rose water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup plain yogurt
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons raw pistachios, toasted and chopped
8 ounces rhubarb (2-3 stalks), trimmed
2 1/2 cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon rose water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons dried rose petals
2 tablespoons raw pistachios, toasted and chopped
12-cup Bundt pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour Bundt pan, tapping out excess flour.
Rub together granulated sugar and lemon zest with your fingers in a large bowl until fragrant. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, cream lemon sugar and 3/4 cup butter until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, scraping down sides of bowl and beating well between each addition. Beat in rose water and vanilla extract on medium-low speed until just combined.
Whisk 2 1/4 cups flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in another large bowl. With mixer on low, add dry ingredients to lemon sugar mixture in 3 additions, alternating with yogurt in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed. Fold in pistachios.
Cut rhubarb crosswise into 2 1/2 inch pieces. Using a mandoline set to 1/4 inch or a very sharp knife, slice rhubarb lengthwise, maintaining as much red skin on stalks as possible.
Pour one-third of the batter into prepared pan and smooth surface. Add half of the rhubarb, nestling pieces side by side to form a thick ring on top of batter. Pour another third of the batter on top of rhubarb layer; smooth surface. Repeat with remaining rhubarb and batter.
Bake cake until the surface is cracked and golden brown, springs back to the touch, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50â60 minutes. Let cake rest in pan 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack.
Whisk powdered sugar, milk, rose water, vanilla extract, and salt in a medium bowl until well combined. Glaze should be pourable but stiff enough to hold its shape-it can be thickened with more powdered sugar or thinned with more milk if needed.
Using a spoon, drizzle rose glaze over cooled cake, holding the spoon a few inches above the cake. While glaze is still wet, sprinkle rose petals and pistachios on top.
Cake can be baked, cooled, wrapped in plastic, and stored at room temperature up to 3 days. Glaze can be made and stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days.

Black-and-White Pancake Cake
1 batch of Maple Chocolate Cake batter
1/2 cup (4 ounces/113 grams) water
1/2 cup (4 1/4 ounces/120 grams) heavy cream, chilled
1/2 cup (4 ounces/113 grams) mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
1 1/2 tablespoons (1 1/8 ounces/32 grams) pure maple syrup (dark or very dark preferred)*
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or pure vanilla extract
5 ounces (142 grams) bittersweet chocolate (60% to 70% cacao), chopped
6 tablespoons (3 ounces/85 grams) heavy cream
A cast-iron griddle, about 10 Ã 17 inches in size**
A very thin, flexible metal spatula, such as a fish spatula

1. Preheat a griddle over low heat for at least 10 minutes. (You want the griddle nice and hot over as low heat as possible to avoid burning the pancakes and to give them ample time to cook through.)
2. Make the pancakes: Whip up a batch of Maple Chocolate Cake, adding the water to the wet ingredients before whisking the batter until smooth.
3. Spray the griddle generously with nonstick spray. Making 2 pancakes at a time, pour two 1/2-cup scoops of batter onto the griddle. Use the back of a spoon to gently swirl and coax the pancakes into 7-inch circles. Cook the pancakes until the edges appear dry and set and bubbles are no longer popping on the surfaces, about 4 minutes on the first side. Use a thin, flexible metal spatula to gently flip the pancakes. Cook about 2 minutes more, or until the centers of the pancakes spring back when lightly touched. Remove the layers to wire racks to cool completely. Repeat the batter scooping and cooking process until you have 8 cake layers.
4. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and place 4 cake layers in a single layer on each sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Make the cream filling: Pour the cream into a medium bowl. Whip the cream on high speed to stiff peaks. In a separate medium bowl, place the mascarpone, maple syrup, and vanilla bean paste. Beat on low speed, just until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken, about 30 seconds-don't overbeat, or the mascarpone will seize. Gently fold in the whipped cream until smooth.
6. Make the ganache filling: Combine the bittersweet chocolate with the cream in a small heatproof bowl. Microwave on high power for 45 to 60 seconds. Whisk the ganache until the chocolate is melted and the ganache is smooth and the texture of chocolate pudding. Remove about 2 tablespoons of ganache to a small bowl and set aside for garnish.
7. To assemble the cake, remove the pancake layers from the refrigerator. Inspect the layers; choose the most handsome to be the top layer and set it aside. Place 1 cake layer on a serving platter or cake stand. Dollop on 1/3 cup ofthe maple mascarpone cream and use a small offset spatula to smooth it out, with a l/2-inch border all around. Place a second layer on top, and press lightly to help it adhere. Spread about 2 1/2 tablespoons of ganache onto the layer, also with a 1/2-inch border around the cake. Continue the layering process 6 more times, alternating maple mascarpone cream and chocolate ganache with the layers, placing the best-looking cake layer on top.
8. To the remaining chocolate ganache, add a drizzle of cream, only about l/2 teaspoon or so, just enough to thin itto a honeylike consistency (warm the ganache in the microwave for about lO seconds or so to loosen it up first, if necessary). Drizzle the ganache artfully over the cake. Chill the cake for about 30 minutes before serving. This cake can be made up to 1 day in advance (let it soften on the counter for 15 minutes before slicing).

Raspberry, Whiskey & Oat Cheesecake
150 grams (5.25 oz) oatcakes
25 grams (5 tbsp) regular rolled oats
1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons superfine sugar
100 grams (7 tbsp) unsalted butter
400 grams (14 oz) full-fat cream cheese
1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sour cream
1/4 cup honey
100 grams (7 tbsp) superfine sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 to 3 tablespoons whiskey
3 large eggs
200 to 300 grams (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 c) fresh raspberries
8-inch round removable bottom or springform pan

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
To make the crust, crush the oatcakes with a rolling pin or in a food processor until sandy and no chunks remain. Stir in the rolled oats and sugar. Melt the butter over low heat in a small pan, then add it to the crushed oatcakes and stir to combine. Add a bit more butter if the mixture feels dry; it needs to be moist enough to hold together in small clumps. Spoon it into the pan and press firmly with the back of a spoon. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until just set (it will firm as it cools). Set aside while you prepare the filling. Turn the oven down to 250 degrees F.
To make the filling, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add the sour cream and stir to combine, then add the honey, sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir in the whiskey to taste. (You can add a little extra, or none at all, if you prefer.) Lightly whisk the eggs in a separate bowl, then gradually add them to the cream cheese mixture while stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming. The mixture should be thick and smooth.
Pour the filling over the pre-baked crust. Bake for about 1 1/2 hours, until the filling is set and has just the slightest wobble in the center. Because it's baked at such a low temperature, it should be barely colored, just deepening to a light gold. Let cool to room temperature in the pan, then unmold and chill.
Shortly before serving, arrange the raspberries on top of the cheesecake, fat ends down and tapered bottoms upward. You can cover with the raspberries earlier, but there's a risk that, if they're particularly ripe, their juices will seep into the creamy cheesecake.

Buckwheat Shortcakes with Earl-Grey Apricot Compote and Whipped Cream
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (1.75 ounces) buckwheat flour
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder, sifted if lumpy
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup heavy cream, plus extra for brushing
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen at least 1 hour and grated on a box grater
Turbinado sugar, for sprinkling
1 cup (6 ounces) dried apricots, sliced in half lengthwise
2 Earl Grey teabags
1 vanilla bean, slit lengthwise
3 tablespoons honey
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
Stand mixer with whisk attachment, electric hand mixer, or whisk (for whipped cream), 2 1/4-inch round biscuit cutter or equally sized straight-sided glass

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with two layers of parchment paper.
In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour the cream into it (set the measuring cup aside) and add the grated frozen butter. Use a rubber spatula to push the dry ingredients from the sides of the bowl into the well, cutting and turning the mixture just until the dry ingredients are almost entirely moistened and the dough looks rough and shaggy. Gather the dough into a ball and knead it gently against the sides of the bowl five or so times, pressing loose pieces into the dough, until it just holds together (it should not be smooth) and the bowl is fairly clean.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and pat into a circle about 3/4-inch thick. Using the biscuit cutter or an overturned glass, and re-patting the dough as needed, cut the dough into 8 even rounds. Place them at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Brush the tops with the cream left in the bottom of the measuring cup or with a little milk, and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar.
Bake the shortcakes until the tops are just barely golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately transfer to a wire rack to cool.
Set a medium saucepan with 2 cups water over high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, add tea bags, and let steep 3 minutes. Remove tea bags and add apricots, honey, and vanilla bean. Return to stove and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat; cook until the apricots are soft and the liquid has reduced to a thick syrup, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove vanilla bean.
Meanwhile, in the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or using a medium mixing bowl and a handheld electric mixer or a whisk, whip the cream, adding the sugar as it begins to thicken. Continue beating until it holds a soft shapeânot too stiff. (The cream can be covered and refrigerated for up to several hours. If liquid separates from the cream, whisk briefly before using.)
To assemble the shortcakes, gently pull each shortcake apart horizontally into two equal halves. Place the bottom halves on serving plates. Top each with a generous scoop of apricot compote (about 2 tablespoons) and a dollop of whipped cream. Cover with the tops of the biscuits and serve.

Rhubarb-Almond Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for pan
1 pound rhubarb stalks, trimmed
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup blanched almonds
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
2 large eggs
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
One 11x8 inch tart pan or one 9 inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Butter tart pan and sprinkle with sugar, tapping out excess. Slice rhubarb in half lengthwise (quarter if very large). Set 8 of the prettiest pieces aside for the top of the cake; chop remaining rhubarb into 1/2 inch pieces. Pulse flour, almonds, baking powder, and salt in a food processor until almonds are finely ground (texture should be sandy).
Place 1 cup butter and 3/4 cup sugar in a large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; reserve pod for another use. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend first egg before adding second. Beat until mixture is pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes.
Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, followed by yogurt. Beat, scraping down the sides of bowl as needed, just to combine (batter will be thick). Fold in chopped rhubarb and scrape batter into prepared pan. Smooth batter and arrange reserved rhubarb over top; sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.
Place tart pan on a large rimmed baking sheet (to catch any rogue juices) and bake, rotating once, until cake is golden brown and rhubarb on top is soft and beginning to brown, 70â80 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool before removing from pan.
Do ahead: Cake can be baked 3 days ahead. Keep tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Miso Doughnuts
2 teaspoons red miso
3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar

Pulse red miso and 1/2 cup sugar in a food processor until mixture resembles brown sugar. Spread out evenly on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and let sit until dry, 2-2 1/2 hours. Pulse in food processor until no clumps remain. Transfer miso sugar to a medium bowl.
Combine 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over and let sit until foamy, 5-10 minutes.
Beat egg, egg yolk, butter, milk, white miso, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (or use a whisk and a medium bowl) until miso breaks up into small pieces and mixture is almost smooth. Add yeast mixture along with bread flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour and mix until a shaggy ball forms (or, use a sturdy wooden spoon and some effort).
Switch to dough hook and mix on medium until dough is soft, smooth, elastic, and climbing up hook, 5-7 minutes. (Or, knead on a lightly floured surface, 8-10 minutes.) If dough is wet, add more all-purpose flour as needed.
Place dough in a large bowl lightly coated with nonstick spray. Cover and let sit in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, 1-2 hours.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; lightly flour. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat out to 1 inch thick. Punch out rounds with biscuit cutter. Repeat with scraps. Transfer rounds to prepared baking sheet, cover loosely, and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, 45-60 minutes.
Pour oil into a large heavy saucepan to a depth of 2 inch. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 325 degrees . Working in batches, fry doughnuts until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels and let cool slightly before tossing in miso sugar.
Do ahead: Dough (before rise) can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.

3/4 cup sugar, divided
6 large eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for egg whites
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 1/3 cups freeze-dried strawberries (1.2-ounce package)
5 egg whites, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
1 cup almond flour (4 ounces)
1 cup superfine sugar
1 tablespoon potato starch
9-inch springform pan

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly brush a 9-inch springform pan with oil and line bottom with a round of parchment paper. Brush parchment with oil and set pan aside.
In a food processor, pulse pistachios with 1/4 cup sugar until finely ground (avoid overgrinding); set aside.
In two large bowls, separate the 6 eggs into yolks and whites, reserving the sixth egg white for another use. Add 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla, salt, and cardamom to bowl with egg yolks and beat using an electric mixer until thick and pale yellow, about 2 minutes.

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
2/3 cup powdered sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1 teaspoon white sesame seeds (not toasted)
1 teaspoon black sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds

Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once or twice, until lightly browned and beginning to smell nutty, 5-8 minutes (do not toast them all the way; they will get baked again). Let cool. Turn off oven.
Pulse pecans, buckwheat flour, salt, baking powder, and 1 cup all-purpose flour in a food processor until pecans are finely ground.
Using an electric mixer on medium. high speed, beat butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low and mix in dry ingredients just to blend. Divide dough in half; wrap each in plastic wrap, flattening into 1/2 inch-thick disks. Chill until very firm, at least 2 hours.

Oat Shortcakes with SautÃ©ed Apples, Cinnamon, and Whipped Cream
3 tablespoons (45 grams) clarified butter or ghee
1 cup (100 grams) oat flour
2/3 cup (130 grams) granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 large Honeycrisp or Gala apples, unpeeled, cut into 1/4-inch wedges
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup packed light-brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for dusting
1/8 teaspoon powdered ginger
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
Stand mixer with whisk attachment or handheld electric mixer, 9-inch square cake pan, sifter or medium-mesh strainer

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of the cake pan with parchment paper, but leave the sides unlined and ungreased.
Put the clarified butter in a small pot or microwavable container ready to reheat when needed, and have a large bowl ready to pour it into as well. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour and 2 tablespoons of the sugar together thoroughly.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine eggs, salt, and remaining granulated sugar; beat on high speed until light-colored and tripled in volume, 4 to 5 minutes. You should see well-defined tracks as the whisk spins; when the whisk is lifted, the mixture should fall in a thick, fluffy rope that dissolves slowly on the surface of the batter.
Just before the egg mixture is ready, heat the clarified butter until very hot and pour it into the reserved large bowl.
Remove the bowl with the egg mixture from the mixer. Sift one-third of the flour mixture over the eggs; fold in with a large rubber spatula until the flour is almost blended into the batter. Repeat with half of the remaining flour, then repeat with the rest of the flour. Scrape about a quarter of the batter into the bowl with the hot clarified butter. Fold until the butter is completely blended into the batter. Scrape the buttery batter over the remaining batter and fold just until blended. Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan.
Bake until the cake is golden brown on top, 30 to 35 minutes. It will have puffed up and then settled level, but it won't have pulled away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean and dry. Set the pan on a rack to cool completely.
When cool, cut around the edge of the cake to release it from the pan, then quickly invert over a cutting board. Cut in a tic-tac-toe grid, creating nine even squares of cake.
While the cake is baking, make the topping: In a medium bowl, toss sliced apples with lemon juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and 1/4 cup water. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat butter until melted. Add apple mixture and stir to combine. Cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, until apples have softened but still hold their shape and the sauce has thickened, 10 to 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, in the chilled bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, or using a handheld electric mixer, whip the cream until it holds a soft shapeânot too stiff. (The cream can be covered and refrigerated for up to several hours. If liquid separates from the cream, whisk briefly before using.)
To serve, top each piece of cake with 4 to 5 cooked apple slices and a drizzle of sauce and garnish with a generous dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Macaroon Matzo Crunch
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
1/2 cup sliced almonds
Nonstick vegetable cooking spray
4 unsalted matzo crackers
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter or unsalted pareve margarine
1 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
5 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate or chocolate chips (about 3/4 cup)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread coconut flakes on 1 baking sheet and almonds on another. Toast until golden brown, about 3 minutes for the coconut and about 7 minutes for the almonds. Set aside.
Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray. Arrange matzo on parchment with no gaps in between (it's ok if they overlap slightly).
Whisk together butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in a medium pot. Whisking occasionally, bring to a high simmer over medium heat, about 3 minutes. Once mixture is simmering, whisk constantly, until it turns a light brown, thickens, and starts to pull away from the sides of the pot, about 3 minutes. Immediately pour onto matzo, covering completely. Using a spatula, quickly spread caramel so matzo has an even coating.
Bake matzo until caramel is golden brown and bubbling, 14-16 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure caramel doesn't burn. If it starts to darken too quickly, remove from oven and lower heat to 325 degrees F; return to oven after a few minutes and continue to bake, watching closely.
Meanwhile, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a small pot of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. (Or, place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring between each burst, until melted.)
Remove matzo from oven and sprinkle immediately with reserved coconut and almonds. Drizzle with chocolate. Let cool slightly, then place the baking sheet with the matzo crunch in the refrigerator until cooled and set, at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Break matzo crunch into pieces and serve.

Maple Chocolate Cake
1 1/2 cups (6 3/4 ounces/192 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
3/4 cup (2 1/2 ounces/72 grams) unsweetened natural cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 cup (11 7/8 ounces/336 grams) pure maple syrup (dark or very dark preferred)*
1 cup (8 1/2 ounces/242 grams) 2% Greek yogurt
2 large eggs
1/4 cup (2 ounces/57 grams) grapeseed, or canola oil
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Lightly grease a 9 Ã 13-inch rectangular baking pan or two 9-inch round pans (and line them with parchment paper), or line 18 wells of two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
3. Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a large measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together the syrup, yogurt, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Using a whisk, energetically blend the batter by hand until smooth and thick, about 1 minute. Spread the batter into the prepared pan or pans. (For fill the cups no more than two-thirds fullâyou should get 18 cupcakes.)
6. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean and the tops of the cakes spring back when lightly touched, 30 to 35 minutes for sheet and/or layer cakes, or 20 minutes for cupcakes. Cool completely in the pans on a wire rack before inverting and frosting.

Oat and Pistachio Sandies
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup old-fashioned oats
1 cup raw pistachios
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar

Pulse flour, oats, pistachios, salt, and baking soda in a food processor to combine (small pieces of oats and pistachio should still be visible).
Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, and powdered sugar in a medium bowl to create air pockets in butter, about 5 minutes; mixture will look light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients, mixing just until blended. Divide dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper and shape into about 1 1/2 inch-diameter logs. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour. (The colder your dough, the easier it will be to cut into even slices.)
Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees . Using a serrated knife, slice logs into 1/4 inch-thick rounds and place on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1/2 inch apart. Bake, rotating baking sheets once, until cookies are golden brown around the edges, 10â12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks; let cool.
Do ahead: Keep dough chilled up to 5 days, or freeze up to 1 month.

Cinnamon-Date Buns
16 Medjool dates, pitted (about 8 ounces)
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup whole milk
4 tablespoons honey, divided

1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Bring dates, salt, and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring and mashing occasionally, until dates are falling apart and water is evaporated (it should be a thick paste), 10-15 minutes. Let cool, then stir in butter, orange zest, and cinnamon.
Do ahead: Date filling can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees . Heat milk and 1 tablespoon honey in a small saucepan until lukewarm. Combine milk mixture and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer. As soon as yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes, add egg yolks, 1 egg, buttermilk, spelt flour, salt, 2 cups all-purpose flour, and remaining 3 tablespoons honey; mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, shiny, and elastic, 5-8 minutes.
With motor running, add 1/2 cup room temperature butter, 1 piece at a time, waiting until each piece is incorporated before adding the next. Mix 1 minute, then increase speed to medium-high and mix until dough is soft and supple, 6-8 minutes. (No stand mixer? Whisk ingredients into yeast mixture in a large bowl, then knead dough on a clean surface. Mix in butter with a sturdy wooden spoon, then knead briefly to make sure butter is well incorporated.)
Place dough in a buttered medium bowl. Brush with melted butter; cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 1â1 1/2 hours (2â2 1/2 hours if dough was made ahead and chilled).
Divide dough in half. Roll out 1 piece on a lightly floured surface to a 15x5 inch rectangle. Evenly spread with half of date filling and cut into 8 triangles. Starting with a pointy end, roll up dough (like a reverse crescent roll). Place, seam side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, date filling, and another baking sheet.
Cover buns with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size, 30â40 minutes.
Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk remaining egg and 1 teaspoon water in another small bowl and brush over buns. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar; bake until golden brown, 20â25 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
Do ahead: Dough (before rise) can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

Pear and Walnut Upside-Down Cake with Whipped CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che
1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), room temperature
3/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 pounds ripe pears, cored and sliced into thin wedges (such as Bartlett or D'Anjou) (about 3 pears)
1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup granulated sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup milk, room temperature
4 tablespoons crÃ¨me fraÃ®che
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
One 9-inch round metal cake pan (at least 2 inches tall)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Cut a half-stick of butter into slices and place it and the brown sugar in the cake pan. Set the pan over a medium-high burner. Stir as the butter and sugar melt together and continue until the mixture gets pale and bubbly, swirly when stirred, and toasty brown, about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool. (Note: If you'd rather not make the caramel in the cake pan, you can use a large skillet instead and simply pour the caramel into the cake pan when done.)
Arrange the pear wedges in the cake pan in an even patter. Sprinkle the walnuts evenly over the pears.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside.
Place the remaining 1 1/2 sticks of butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl. Beat the heck out of the butter using the paddle attachment of a stand mixer or a hand mixer until it gets lighter in both color and consistency. Add the sugar and beat until well blended and fluffy.
Separate the egg yolks from the whites and set the whites aside in a medium bowl. Stir the yolks into the butter mixture until completely blended (no need to beat, and then stir the vanilla. Add half the dry ingredients and stir until mixed in. Stir in the milk until completely smooth, then the rest of the dry ingredients just until fully incorporated; set aside.
Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the egg whites until very fluffy. The whites should look shiny with soft peaksâstop whisking before they get dry looking. Gently but thoroughly fold the whipped whites into the batterâall the air that you just whipped in will go out of the whites if you over-mix at this point. Pour the batter over the fruit and gently smooth the top.
Put the cake in the oven and start checking for doneness in 35 minutes: peek in, give the pan a tiny nudge, and look for jigglyness in the center. If it wobbles and looks soft and crinkled on top, gently close the door and set the timer for 5 more minutes. If it's looking set, slide the rack out and touch the top of the cake with your fingers, testing for bounce-back. If your touch leaves a dent that stays, return the cake to the oven. If it does spring back, the final test is sticking a toothpick into center of the cake. When it comes out moist, but crumb-free, it's done!
Let the cake cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edge, invert a plate on top of the pan, and carefully but quickly flip it over. Tap the bottom of the pan if the cake doesn't fall onto the plate on its own. Lift the pan away and replace any pear slices that may have stuck there.
When ready to serve, combine all the ingredients for the whipped crÃ¨me fraÃ®che in a large bowl; whip until thick and fluffy, but still soft.
Slice the cake and serve each wedge with a dollop of whipped crÃ¨me fraÃ®che.

Corn Flour Shortcakes with Blackberries and Whipped Cream
1/2 cup (110 grams) granulated sugar, divided
3 large egg yolks, at room temperature
1/4 cup flavorless vegetable oil (such as corn or safflower)
1/2 cup (70 grams) corn flour
1/4 cup (40 grams) white rice flour (Bob's Red Mill makes a good one)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 cups (12 ounces) fresh blackberries
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup sour cream
Pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
Stand mixer with whisk attachment or handheld electric mixer, 9-inch square cake pan

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper but leave the sides unlined and ungreased.
Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sugar for later (to stiffen the egg whites).
Add the remaining sugar to a large mixing bowl with egg yolks, oil, corn flour, rice flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/4 cup water. Whisk to blend thoroughly. Set aside for 15 minutes to hydrate the corn flour while the oven is heating.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the egg whites and cream of tartar and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is creamy white and holds a soft shape. Slowly sprinkle in the reserved 2 tablespoons sugar, beating at high speed until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Scrape half of the egg whites onto the corn batter and fold until partially blended. Add the remaining egg whites and fold just until the batter looks blended. Scrape the batter into the pan and spread it evenly.
Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
Set the pan on a cooling rack. Immediately, while the cake is still hot, slide a thin knife or spatula around the sides, pressing against the pan to avoid tearing the cake. Leave the cake in the pan to coolâit will settle at a bit and pull away from the edges of the pan.
When cool, carefully invert the cake onto a cutting board. Cut the cake into 8 even rectangles, about 2x4-inches each.
In a medium bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cup of the blackberries with the and lemon juice. Let stand 30 minutes, then stir and mash with the back of a spoon to break up the berries. When ready to serve, stir in remaining 1/2 cup fresh blackberries.
Meanwhile, pour heavy cream into the chilled bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high until soft peaks form. Turn speed to low and gently whisk in sour cream, salt, and sugar. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
To serve, slice each rectangle in half horizontally. Top the bottom half with a spoonful (about 3 tablespoons) of blackberries and their sauce, and then garnish with a generous dollop of whipped cream and place the top half of the cake on top. Repeat to form remaining servings.

Buckwheat Linzer Cookies
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (55 grams) white rice flour
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (70 grams) buckwheat flour
2/3 cup (65 grams) oat flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar
1/4 cup (60 grams) cream cheese, cut into chunks
12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks/170 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks and softened
1 tablespoon water
Buckwheat sablÃ©s dough, shaped into logs and chilled as directed
1/2 cup blackberry (or other) preserves
Powdered sugar for dusting
Baking sheets, lined with parchment paper
7/8-inch round cookie cutter (or bottle cap to improvise)
Sifter or medium-fine mesh strainer

To make the dough by hand, put the rice flour, buckwheat flour, oat flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until thoroughly blended. Add the cream cheese, butter, and water. Use a fork or the back of a large spoon to mash and mix the ingredients together until all are blended into a smooth, soft dough.
To make the dough in a food processor, combine the rice flour, buckwheat flour, oat flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar. Pulse to mix thoroughly. Add the cream cheese, butter, and water. Process just until the mixture forms a ball of smooth, soft dough. Scrape the bowl and blend in any stray flour at the bottom with your fingers.
Scrape the dough onto a sheet of wax paper and form it into two 8-inch logs about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly in the wax paper and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but preferably longer or overnight.
Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Use a sharp knife to cut the cold logs of dough into 1/4-inch slices. Place the cookies at least 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the sheets from front to back and top to bottom about halfway through the baking time, until the cookies are slightly darker brown at the edges and well browned on the bottom.
Set the pans or just the liners on racks to cool. Cool completely before stacking or storing. Cookies may be stored in an airtight container for at least 2 weeks.
Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Slice the chilled logs less than 1/4 inch thick and place the slices 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets, dividing the total number equally between them. Bake for about 12 minutes. Remove the upper sheet of cookies and place it on the counter or stovetop. Press the cookie cutter gently into each cookie. If the centers lift out, fine; otherwise you can remove them later. Switch and rotate sheets, placing the first on the lower rack in place of the second. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are slightly darker at the edges and well browned on the bottom.
Set the pans or just the liners on racks to cool. Cool completely. Remove the cutouts. Unfilled cookies may be stored in an airtight container for at least 2 weeks.
Shortly before serving, spread 1/2 teaspoon of preserves on the cookies without holes. Sieve a little powdered sugar over the cookies with holes and place one on top of each jam-topped cookie.

Ginger-Curry Sugar Cookies
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, diced (140 grams)
1 large egg
Seeds from 1 vanilla bean
1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (208 grams)
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar (90 grams)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger (3 grams)
1 teaspoon mild curry powder (2 grams)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (2 grams)
Demerara sugar, for rolling
2 large egg yolks, beaten
Maldon sea salt, for sprinkling
24 one-inch slices crystallized ginger, halved crosswise

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-low speed for about 5 minutes, until a thick, smooth paste forms. Add the egg and vanilla seeds and mix until combined.
Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, sift together the flour, confectioners' sugar, ginger, and curry powder; sprinkle the kosher salt over the top. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the butter and mix until just combined.
Divide the dough between 2 sheets of parchment and form into long thin logs, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Fold the paper over the dough roll and use a pastry scraper to tighten the dough log. Use your hands to smooth and form the dough into as perfect a cylinder as you can. Refrigerate until firm.
When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
Using 2 hands, roll the dough logs firmly on a work surface to round out any edges. Sprinkle the Demerara sugar onto another baking sheet. Unwrap the dough and, using a pastry brush, brush the surface with beaten egg yolk. Roll the dough in the sugar and slice it with a sharp knife into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Brush the surface of each cookie with beaten yolk, sprinkle a few flakes of Maldon salt on top, and press a piece of crystallized ginger into the center of each cookie.
Space the cookies about 1 inch apart on the lined baking sheets and bake for 15 to 16 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the edges are just beginning to turn golden. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

Double Chocolate Chunk Walnut Cookies
Cooking spray or oil mister (optional)
1/2 cup raw sugar
1/3 cup unpacked dark brown sugar
1/4 cup mashed avocado
1 tablespoon unsweetened applesauce
1 large egg white
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup (65 grams) white whole wheat unbleached flour (I recommend King Arthur)
1/3 cup (50 grams) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Trader Joe's)
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chunks
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 regular baking sheets with silicone baking mats (such as Silpats) or lightly spray nonstick baking sheets with oil.
In a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer, whisk together the sugars, avocado, applesauce, egg white, and vanilla until the sugar dissolves, about 2 to 3 minutes.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together the flours, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold in the dry ingredients with a spatula in two additions. Using a spatula, fold in the chocolate chunks and walnuts. The dough will be very sticky. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 15 minutes.
Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls about 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheets and smooth the tops.
Bake until almost set, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes on the pan, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Upside-Down Fruit Cake
2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons softened butter, plus more for greasing
1 1/4 packed cups light-brown sugar
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup sour cream
4 eggs, room temperature
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
8-10 firmish ripe plums
4 tablespoons light-brown sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Use a little butter to grease a 9-inch round springform pan, then line the base with parchment paper. Wrap the base of the pan with aluminum foil.
Halve and pit the plums, then cut each half into 3 wedges. Toss them with 4 tablespoons light-brown sugar.
Arrange the fruit in the bottom of the pan in neat rings. They must be in a single layer. Make sure you add all the sugar.
Put the butter in a mixing bowl with the dry ingredients, sour cream, eggs, and almond extract.
Use an electric mixer to beat everything to a smooth, fairly thick cake batter. Spoon the batter on top of the fruit, then smooth the top. Bake until the cake is golden and has risen, 55 minutes to 1 hour. A skewer should come out clean when inserted in the center. Run an icing spatula or table knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake, then let cool on a cooling rack.
Serve the cake warm. If you need to reheat it, cover it loosely with foil and warm in a low oven for 15 minutes.

Matcha-White Chocolate Sugar Cookies
3/4 cup granulated sugar, divided
1/2 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons matcha
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 cup (2 sticks) plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature
1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
3 ounces white chocolate, chopped

Whisk 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoons matcha in a small bowl; set aside.
Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons matcha in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on mediumhigh speed, beat butter, brown sugar, honey, and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg, egg yolk, and lemon zest and mix until very pale, about 4 minutes.
Reduce mixer speed to low and, with motor running, add flour mixture; mix until no dry spots remain. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, mix in white chocolate.
Wrap dough in plastic and chill at least 2 hours and up to 5 days. If chilling more than a few hours, let dough sit at room temperature 1 hour to soften before scooping and baking.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Scoop the dough by the scant tablespoonful onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. (Or, for neat and tidy cookies with perfect edges, like the ones in our photo, portion same amount of dough into the cups of a mini muffin pan coated with nonstick vegetable oil spray.)
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until bottoms and edges are barely golden and cooked (top will no longer look wet), 8â10 minutes.
Immediatelyâbut gentlyâtoss cookies in reserved matcha sugar and place on wire racks; let cool.

All-in-One Sugar Cookie Dough
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
electric mixer, cookie cutters (if making roll-and-cut cookies)

In a medium bowl, whisk flour and salt together. In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar until well combined and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until just combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually blend in the flour mixture; mix until just combined.
Form dough into two equal-sized balls and flatten into discs. Wrap both in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.
Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Prepare a well-floured surface and a well-floured rolling pin to help keep the dough from sticking. Working with one disc at a time, roll dough to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out as many cookies as possible with cookie cutters (if dough becomes too soft, chill until firm). Arrange cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on two ungreased baking sheets and chill 15 minutes. Gather scraps, form into a small disc, and chill until firm.
Bake cookies until golden brown at edges (rotating baking sheets and switching position on racks halfway through), 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to cooling racks to cool completely.
Roll out the second disc of dough and scraps (reroll scraps only once) and bake on cooled baking sheets. Transfer to racks to cool completely. Decorate, if desired.
Halve dough and form into two logs, 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap logs in plastic and roll to form a more uniform round shape. Chill at least 2 hours.
Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Slice cookies into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and arrange 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake cookies until golden brown at edges (rotating baking sheets and switching position on racks halfway through), 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to cooling racks to cool completely. Decorate, if desired.
Pistachio-Cranberry: After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 3/4 cup dried unsweetened cranberries and 3/4 cup chopped pistachios. Mix gently to incorporate.
Lemon-Thyme: After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 1 tablespoon lemon zest and 1 tablespoon picked fresh thyme leaves. Mix gently to incorporate. After baked cookies have cooled, make a simple glaze, if desired: whisk together 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk. Spoon a small amount onto the center of each cookie and top with additional lemon zest and thyme leaves.
Chai-Spiced with Crystallized Ginger: When combining the dry ingredients, whisk in 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon ground clove, and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 3/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger. Mix gently to incorporate. Sprinkle with sanding sugar or sugar in the raw, if desired, before baking.
Carrot Cake: When combining the dry ingredients, whisk in 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 3/4 cup finely grated carrot and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts. Mix gently to incorporate.
To make Carrot-Cake Sandwich Cookies: Follow the slice-and-bake method above to bake cookies. To make sandwich filling, use an electric mixer to beat 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter on medium-high until smooth and fluffy. Add 8 ounces room temperature bar cream cheese and beat until well blended. Add 2 1/2 cups sifted confectioner's sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix on medium-low until well combined. Spread 2 to 3 teaspoons of filling on the flat side of a baked cookie, and then top with another cookie (domed side up) to form a sandwich. Repeat with the rest of the cookies.
Mocha: Whisk 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder into the dry ingredients. Follow the rest of the procedure as written above in the base recipe.
To make Mocha-Caramel Sandwich Cookies: Follow the slice-and-bake method above to bake cookies. To assemble the sandwiches, spread homemade or store-bought dulce de leche caramel on the flat side of a baked cookie, then top with another cookie (domed side up) to form a sandwich. Repeat with the rest of the cookies.

Crunchy Meringue Cookies
5 large egg whites
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
3/4 cup granulated sugar (150 grams)
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar (180 grams)

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Put the egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer with the whisk and turn the mixer on to medium. Whip until the whites are foamy and then slightly increase the speed. Continue whipping until the whites have tripled in volume and are fluffy but still soft. The whites should just be starting to hold the trail of the whisk along the sides of the bowl.
With the motor running, very slowly sprinkle another 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar onto the whites between the bowl and the edge of the whisk. Slightly increase the mixer speed and whip until the whites start to turn glossy but are still soft. Slowly sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and increase the heat to medium-high. Whip for 2 to 3 minutes longer, until very stiff and glossy but not dry. Transfer the whites to a very large mixing bowl.
Put the confectioners' sugar into a fine-mesh strainer. Sift about one quarter of it onto the whipped whites. Using the largest rubber spatula you have, gently fold the sugar into the meringue, drawing the spatula through the meringue and pulling it up and over itself from the sides of the bowl in. Move slowly and precisely so you don't knock the air out of the whites. Continue sifting and folding in the sugar in 2 or 3 more additions. Once the whites are smooth with no lumps of confectioners' sugar, they are ready.
The meringue can be transferred to a pastry bag with a star tip or into a resealable plastic food bag with the corner snipped and used to pipe stars, circles, or any shape you like onto the lined baking sheets. You can make the cookies as small as dimes to sprinkle over ice cream or large enough to sandwich ice cream between them. Or use 2 spoons to mound the meringue into pillows.
Bake for 1 hour, rotating and switching the pans halfway through. Baking time may vary depending on the size of the meringues; the cookies should feel dry, light, and hollow and have no give when you press on them. If they still feel soft, bake for 15 minutes longer and test again. Turn the oven off and let the meringues cool completely in the oven. Store the cooled meringues in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

Add the brown sugar and break up any lumps. Make a well in the center and add the butter mixture. Using a whisk, slowly mix the ingredients together, then give it a good beating until smooth and evenly blended. Using a spatula, divide the batter equally between the pans and spread it flat.
Bake until the cakes are risen, firm, and have shrunk back slightly from the edges of the pans. Let cool in the pans 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.
Make the frosting: In a medium saucepan, stir the condensed milk and cream over low heat until it starts to bubble at the edges. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate, butter, and vanilla. Let the chocolate melt, stirring and beating occasionally as it cools, until thick, fudgy, and completely cooled.
Assemble the cake: On a cake plate lined with strips of parchment paper, sandwich the cakes together with 1/2 cup frosting. Spoon the remaining frosting over the top of the cake. Spread it out thickly, then, working on a quarter of the cake at a time, work the frosting over the edge of the cake and down to meet the plate. Try to keep going in one fluid movement. Repeat all over. Smooth and swirl the frosting as you like, or leave it rough.
Let the cake sit somewhere cool for an hour (or up to a day) before slicing.

Mamool Walnut Cookies
3 pounds pistachio or walnuts, shelled and coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons butter, ghee or corn oil
3 tablespoons rose water
3 tablespoons orange blossom water
1 cup superfine sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Pinch ground cloves
2 pounds fine semolina flour
1 pound white farina
1 pound all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon mastic
1 tablespoon mahlab
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
2 cups milk or orange blossom water
Confectioners' sugar for dusting

Make the filling: In a large bowl, combine the nuts with the butter, rose water, orange blossom water, sugar, cinnamon and cloves; stir to thoroughly coat the nuts. Set aside.
Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the semolina, farina and flour. Sprinkle the mastic and mahlab over the dry ingredients. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the yeast and sugar to the well. Add 3 tablespoons warm water to the yeast mixture and let sit until it begins to foam, about 1 minute. Pour in the milk and, with a fork, gradually mix the wet and dry ingredients together until a dough forms.
Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and knead until it is pillow soft and workable. If the dough becomes too stiff to work with, gradually sprinkle in water to bring it to a workable consistency. Return the dough to the bowl and set aside on the counter for 1 hour, covering the bowl with a clean kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out as you shape the cookies.
Preheat the oven to 370 degrees F. Prepare two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Place about 3 tablespoons dough in the palm of one hand and use the other palm to roll it into a ball. Make an indentation in the ball with your finger. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of the nut mixture into the indentation, then bring the edges of the dough up around the filling. Pinch the edges all around to seal in the filling. Flip the cookie over into the other hand, seam-side down, and gently press until the seam side is flattened. Place the cookie on a prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough.
Bake until the cookies are pale blond, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. The cookies can be stored at room temperature for 2 days; they will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks or in the freezer up to 3 months. Before serving, dust liberally with confectioners' sugar.

Peaches Using the tip of a paring knife, score an X in the bottom of each peach. Cook in a large pot of boiling water just until skins begin to peel back where cut, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Peel; cut over a medium bowl into 1/4 inch-thick wedges, collecting juices.
Add tarragon and sugar to peaches and toss to combine. Let stand, tossing occasionally, until peaches release their juices and sugar is dissolved, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees . Heat butter and tarragon in a small saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted; set aside.
Whisk cake flour, baking powder, salt, 1 cup all-purpose flour, and 2 teaspoons sugar in a large bowl. Drizzle chilled cream over and mix gently until dough holds together.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a shaggy ball, being careful not to overwork. Place on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and form into an 8 inch-diameter disk, about 1/2 inch thick. Brush with some reserved melted butter and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake until shortcake edges are golden brown, 12â15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees . Bake until golden brown all over, 8â10 minutes longer.
Brush shortcake with remaining melted butter. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Cut shortcake into 8 wedges, spoon peaches and their juices over, and top with whipped cream.

Samoas Girl Scout Cookie Ice Cream Cake
3 (7-ounce) boxes Samoas (Caramel deLites) Girl Scout cookies, coarsely chopped
3 pints vanilla ice cream, slightly softened
1/2 cup purchased or homemade caramel sauce
1/2 cup purchased or homemade chocolate sauce
Equipment: 1 (9-inch-round, 1-inch-deep) cake pan; plastic wrap

Line a 9-inch-round, 1-inch-deep cake pan with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic is tucked into the sides of the pan and leaving at least a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Fill the bottom of the pan with about 1/3 of the coarsely chopped cookies, arranging them so that they lay flat against the cake pan (there will be some small gaps in the  inchcrust inch).
In a large bowl, combine the remaining chopped cookies with the slightly softened vanilla ice cream, folding to incorporate the cookies into the ice cream. Spoon the ice cream on top of the cookies in the pan, packing it down into the cookie crust. Use a knife to spread the ice cream evenly and smooth the top. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the ice cream then wrap the entire cake pan in a double layer of plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. DO AHEAD: The ice cream cake can be prepared ahead, wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap, and frozen up for to 2 days.
In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the caramel sauce. In a second small saucepan over low heat, warm the chocolate sauce.
Take the ice cream cake out of the freezer and remove the double layer of plastic wrap, along with the plastic wrap pressed on the surface of the ice cream. Using the overhanging plastic wrap that lines the pan, carefully lift the cake from the pan and place it on a large plate or serving platter. Place a second large plate on top of the cake then invert the cake, remove the first plate, and peel off the plastic wrap. Place the original large plate or platter on top of the cake and invert it a final time so that the cookie crust is on the bottom. Using 2 small spoons, drizzle the chocolate and caramel sauces over the ice cream cake. Serve immediately.

Sophie's Chocolate Biscuit Cake
250g (9oz) milk chocolate
100g (4oz) unsalted butter
5 tbsp whipping cream
1 tbsp golden syrup
400g (14oz) packet digestive biscuits
100g (4oz) white chocolate (optional)

Break the chocolate into squares and place in a heatproof bowl with the butter. Set over a pan of simmering water and allow to melt. Remove from the heat and mix in the cream and golden syrup by hand, which will take a few minutes.
Break the digestive biscuits into large chunks and gently fold into the chocolate mixture so as not to break up the biscuits too much. Using a spatula, transfer to a 900ml (1 1/2 pints) loaf tin that has been double lined with clingfilm, as this makes the cake much easier to lift out. Chill for at least 2 hours, though overnight is best.
To serve, turn out the chocolate biscuit cake onto a platter. Break the white chocolate into squares, if using, and melt in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Drizzle all over the chocolate biscuit cake and leave at room temperature to set for about 20 minutes before cutting into slices and arranging on plates.

Scrape batter into prepared pan and run a spatula through the center, creating a canal. Sprinkle with coconut and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake cake, tenting with foil if coconut browns too much before cake is done (it should be very dark and toasted), until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 70â80 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack; let cake cool in pan 20 minutes before turning out.
DO AHEAD: Cake can be baked 5 days ahead. Keep tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Tagalongs Girl Scout Cookie Mousse Cake
2 ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened) or semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 (6.5-ounce) box Tagalongs/Peanut Butter Patties Girl Scout cookies
1 1/2 cups peanut butter chips (about 9 ounces)
2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream
3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter (not natural, old-fashioned, or freshly ground)
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons sugar
Equipment: 1 (9- by 5-inch) loaf pan; plastic wrap; stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment

Line a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic is tucked into the corners and leaving at least a 2-inch overhang on all sides.
In a dry metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring until smooth. Let cool slightly.
Spread a small amount of melted chocolate on the rounded side of 9 cookies and place 3 of them, chocolate side down, on the bottom of the pan, in a row. Place another 3 cookies against each long side of the pan with the chocolate-coated sides facing the pan. Place the pan in the freezer.
In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the peanut butter chips with 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream. Warm, stirring frequently, until the peanut butter chips are just melted. Remove from the heat and continue to stir until the mixture is smooth. Add the peanut butter and the vanilla and stir until incorporated.
In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups heavy cream with the sugar and beat until the cream is very thick but not yet holding peaks. Add the whipped cream to the peanut butter mixture in 3 additions and fold in just until the mousse is streak-free.
Carefully spoon about 3/4 of the mousse into the prepared pan, being careful not to move the cookies. Insert the remaining cookies into the mousse, arranging them in a row down the center of the loaf pan. Spread the remaining mousse over the wafers and carefully smooth the top. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the mousse then wrap the entire pan in a double layer of plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. DO AHEAD: The mousse cake can be made ahead, wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap, and chilled for up to 3 days.

Using the overhanging plastic wrap that lines the pan, carefully lift and loosen the cake from the pan without removing it. Place a large plate or platter on top of the pan then invert the cake and the plate. Remove the pan and the plastic wrap and serve immediately.

Buckwheat, Bergamot & Blood Orange Chiffon Cake
1 T lemon juice
1 1/2 t powdered gelatin
170 g/ 1/2 cup blood orange marmalade
71 g/ 1/2 cup Candied Kumquats , or other citrus peel in syrup
206 g/1 1/2 cups whole-grain buckwheat flour
1 3/4 t baking powder
1 t fine sea salt
124 g/ 1/2 cup plus 2 T superfine sugar
114 g/ 1/2 cup whole milk
65 g/3 egg yolks
56 g/ 1/4 cup grapeseed oil
37 g/2 T plus 1 t water
289 g/10 egg whites
1/4 t cream of tartar or lemon juice
114 g/ 1/2 cup water
100 g/ 1/2 cup sugar
114 g/ 1/2 cup bergamot or blood orange juice
220 g/1 1/3 cups chopped bittersweet chocolate (70%), preferably Valrhona
6 g/2 T loose-leaf Earl Grey tea (or 4 tea bags) steeped overnight in 220 g/1 cup cold heavy cream
220 g/1 cup whole milk
86 g/4 egg yolks, at room temperature
42 g/3 T sugar
Cocoa powder for dusting

To make the filling: Pour the lemon juice into a medium nonreactive bowl and add the gelatin. Stir to dissolve the gelatin, then add the marmalade and the candied citrus. Refrigerate until cool and set, about 2 hours (this can be made and refrigerated up to a day ahead).
To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F/165 degrees C. Line the bottom of 10-in/25-cm springform cake pan with parchment paper and set aside.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Add 100 g /1/2 cup of the sugar and whisk to combine.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, egg yolks, oil, and water. Make a well in the flour, add the yolk mixture, then whisk thoroughly and quickly for about 1 minute until very smooth.
Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat on medium-high speed until the whites hold soft peaks. Slowly add the remaining 24 g/2 tablespoons sugar and beat on medium-high speed until the whites hold firm, shiny peaks. Using a rubber spatula, scoop about one-third of the whites into the bowl containing the batter and, with the rubber spatula, gently fold in to lighten the batter. Gently fold the remaining whites into the batter just until combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with an offset spatula. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack. To unmold, run a paring knife around the inside of the pan to loosen the cake, release and remove the outside ring of the pan, then invert the cake onto the wire rack and peel off the parchment. (The cake will keep, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.)
To make the syrup: In a medium saucepan over medium heat combine the water, sugar, and bergamot juice and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
Wash, dry, and reassemble the springform pan. With a long, thin, serrated knife, cut the cake lengthwise into five equal layers. Place one layer in the bottom of the springform pan.
To make the ganache: Place a saucepan of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Set a heatproof bowl over the water, taking care that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Add the chocolate and heat until halfway melted. Stir gently, remove from the heat, and let cool until it registers between 95 degrees F/35 degrees C and 115 degrees F/46 degrees C on an instant-read thermometer.
Remove the tea-infused cream from the refrigerator and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a separate medium saucepan (if using tea bags, simply discard them). Add the milk and place over medium heat. Heat until it comes to just a boil, stirring occasionally.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisking constantly, pour one-third of the hot cream mixture into the yolk-sugar mixture, then add this mixture to the remaining cream. Stir constantly over medium heat with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and let it cool until it registers 140 degrees F/60 degrees C on an instant-read thermometer. This is your crÃ¨me Anglaise.
Measure out 600 g/2 1/4 cups crÃ©me Anglaise and add to the chocolate in four or five additions, using a heatproof spatula and vigorous strokes to incorporate. The temperature of the mixture should not exceed 113 degrees F/43 degrees C, which is why the cream is added in several additions. The mixture may appear broken at first but should come together by the final addition of cream to be smooth and glossy. Let cool slightly. With a handheld immersion blender, blend the ganache until completely smooth and uniform. (A whisk is also fine, but an immersion blender makes for an ultra-silky ganache that pours very nicely.) Use immediately.
Using a pastry brush, soak the cake layer in the pan with one-quarter of the bergamot syrup. With an offset spatula, spread a thin layer of ganache (about 1/4 in/6 mm thick) over the cake. Top with a second cake layer, soak with an additional one-quarter of bergamot syrup, and then spread with half of the marmalade filling. Top with a third layer and repeat the process, alternating with one more layer of ganache and one more layer of marmalade filling, soaking each cake layer well with syrup. Top with the final cake layer, soak with the remaining syrup, and refrigerate until the cake is firm, 1 to 2 hours, then dust with cocoa powder.
Remove the cake from the refrigerator 2 hours before serving to bring to room temperature. To store, cover tightly and keep in a cool place for up to 4 days.

2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2/3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for coating the canister
1/2 teaspoon salt

1 Generously grease the inside of the slow cooker canister by holding a small slice of butter with a paper towel and rubbing the butter all over the surfaces. Add some flour, then turn the crock this way and that to coat both the bottom and the walls with a fine, even dusting. Tap out any excess flour.
2 Set up a double boiler with about 1 inch of water in the bottom pan, simmering over medium heatâor place a large, heat-safe metal bowl over a medium saucepan with a similar amount of simmering water. Add the butter and both chocolates. Stir with a rubber spatula until about two-thirds of the chocolate has melted. Remove the top half of the double boiler or the bowl from the saucepan below, then continue stirring off the heat until all the chocolate has melted. Cool for 10 minutes.
3 Meanwhile, beat the sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until quite thick and pale yellow, up to 10 minutes.
4 Beat in the cooled chocolate mixture until smooth, then scrape down and remove the beaters. Fold in the flour and salt with a rubber spatula, using wide, gentle arcs to make sure every speck of flour has been moistened. Pour and spread this mixture into the slow cooker.
5 Lay long strips of paper towels across the top of the slow cooker, overlapping each other and hanging down the sides for stability. Set the lid in place, then cook on high for about 1 hour 20 minutes in a small (2- to 3 1/2-quart) slow cooker, about 1 hour 40 minutes in a medium (4- to 5 1/2-quart) one, or about 2 hours in a large (6- to 8-quart) model, or until the cake is firm to the touch and the edges are dry while the middle is dark and moist. Unplug, uncover, and cool in the canister for 30 minutes before cutting out slices with a nonstick-safe knife or setting a cutting board over the cooker, inverting it, and turning the cake out.

Rosemary and Toasted-Caraway Shortbread
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus whole leaves
1 large egg, beaten to blend
Coarse sanding sugar (for sprinkling)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toast caraway seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Coarsely chop; set aside.
Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, powdered sugar, and salt until very light and fluffy, 7â10 minutes (beating air into butter makes for tender shortbread). Reduce speed to low and add flour, caraway, and 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary; mix just to combine. Dough will look shaggy and a little dry (it's not!).
Press dough into two 8 inch-diameter cake pans. Brush with egg, sprinkle with sanding sugar, and top with rosemary leaves.
Bake until shortbread is golden brown and sides pull away from pan, 20â25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack; let cool in pan before turning out and cutting into wedges or bars.
MAKE AHEAD: Shortbread dough can be made 1 month ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Shortbread can be baked 1 week ahead; store wrapped tightly at room temperature.

Cherry Pistachio Slice-and-Bake Cookies
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Heat oven to 350 degrees . Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Spread nuts on a cutting board; roll logs in nuts. Cut logs into 20 slices each and arrange on baking sheets. Press cookies lightly. Bake until golden, 8 to 9 minutes; transfer to wire rack.

Gingerbread Cookie Sandwiches
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup (firmly packed) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1/4 cup molasses
1/3 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon milk, plus more as needed

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugars together until they appear light and fluffy. Add the egg and mix to combine. Add the molasses and mix to combine, scraping down the sides of the bowl once if needed.
2. Working in three batches, add the dry ingredients, mixing between each addition until just incorporated. Remove the dough and turn it out onto a sheet of plastic wrap; form into a disk, wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. (Dough can be made up to 1 day ahead.)
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the dough and cut it in half. Re-wrap one half and place back in the fridge; let the other sit at room temperature a few minutes to soften slightly. Lightly flour a work surface and your rolling pin, and roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick.
4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using cookie cutters, cut out the gingerbread men, and transfer to the prepared sheets. (If the dough feels very soft, refrigerate the gingerbread men on the baking sheet for 15 minutes before placing in the oven to bake.) Bake until cookies appear firm and like they're just starting to crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove and let cool on the sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely.
5. Meanwhile, make the sandwich filling. Beat together the butter, vanilla, and salt until fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar in 2 batches and beat on low speed until incorporated. Add the milk and beat until the mixture is thick but spreadable, adding more milk in 1 teaspoon increments as needed. Spread some of the icing onto half of the cooled gingerbread men; sandwich each with another cookie.

Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, for greasing the pans
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 cups packed light brown sugar
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup safflower or canola oil
1 pound carrots, trimmed, peeled, and coarsely grated on the largest holes of a box grater or the fine grating blade of food processor (about 3 lightly packed cups total)
2/3 cup walnuts or pecans, coarsely chopped, plus more lightly toasted nuts for garnish
2/3 cup dark or golden raisins
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, chilled
11 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
1 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted after measuring
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
Equipment: 2 (9-inch-round, 2-inch-deep) cake pans or 1 (9- by 13-inch) baking pan; parchment paper; stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; 1 to 2 wire cooling racks

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of 2 (9-inch-round, 2-inch-deep) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the brown sugar on the lowest speed to break up any lumps. Add 1 egg and continue to mix on low until smooth and incorporated. Add the remaining eggs, one at a time, and mix on low until smooth and incorporated. Shut off the mixer and scrape down the bowl and paddle. Return the mixer to low then add the oil in a thin steady stream and continue to beat until fully incorporated.
Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, using a large rubber spatula to fold the mixture together until just incorporated. Fold in the carrots, along with the nuts and raisins, if using.
Divide the batter between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake until the layers are firm and risen and the tip of a paring knife inserted in the center of the cake emerges clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to let cool for 5 minutes then invert the cake layers onto the rack and peel off the parchment paper. Use another rack or a large plate to invert the cake layers again then slide them back on to the rack so they are right side up. Let the cake layers cool completely. DO AHEAD: The cakes can be baked ahead, cooled, wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap, and refrigerated for up to 2 days, or frozen up to 1 month.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese and butter and beat on medium until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Shut off the mixer and scrape down the bowl and paddle. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla, and beat on medium, scraping down the bowl and paddle as necessary, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Place 1 cake layer on a large plate and cover the top with about 1/3 of the frosting. Invert the second layer on top of the frosted bottom layer so that the flat side (the bottom) is on top. Spread the remaining frosting on the sides and top of the cake. If you used walnuts or pecans in the cake, sprinkle the frosting with a few tablespoons of lightly toasted chopped nuts. Keep at cool room temperature until serving time. DO AHEAD: Carrot cake can be baked and frosted ahead and kept, in an airtight cake dome, at cool room temperature, for 2 to 3 days.

Cinnamon Bun Bundt Cake
1 envelope (1/4 ounce, 2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast
1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees  to 110 degrees F)
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
4 large egg yolks
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour (spooned into cup and leveled off)
Vegetable oil for the bowl
Flour for the work surface
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan
2/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
When purchasing packages of yeast, be sure and check the  inchuse by inch date so you are working with yeast that is truly active. If you're uncertain about the temperature of the water you're using to activate it, use an instant-read thermometer to make sure you get to 105 degrees  to 110 degrees F.

In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar in the warm water. Let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.
Meanwhile, in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and 1/4 cup granulated sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg yolks, buttermilk, and salt until well combined.
Beat in the yeast mixture. But in 3 1/2 cups of the flour until combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, adding more flour if necessary.
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature until doubled in volume, about I hour. (If you've got an 8-cup or larger clear measuring cup, use this as your bowlâthis makes it really easy to see if the dough has doubled.)
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll to a 12 Ã 18-inch rectangle. Brush weigh 3 tablespoons of the melted butter. In a small bowl, combine the 2/3 cup brown sugar, the cinnamon, and salt and sprinkle over the dough. Starting at one short end, roll into a cylinder. Cut crosswise into 10 equal pieces.
Brush a 10- to 12-cup Bundt pan with melted butter and coat with the 3 tablespoons brown sugar. Place the pieces of dough, seam side down, around the pan, angling the pieces slightly so that no piece completely covers the swirl pattern of its neighbor. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until light and puffed, about 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Bake for 35 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown and well risen. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert onto a cake plate. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Tarte Bourdaloue
2 Bosc or Anjou pears, peeled, cored and quartered
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup white wine (pick something delicious, fruity, and not too expensive: ask the clerk at the wine store to help you)
2 cups peeled, shredded, drained, and pressed pears (about 2 large cooking pears)
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 1/4 cup canola oil or grapeseed oil
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
4 large eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 cup whole almonds
1/2 teaspoon unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
One recipe French Buttercream
1 1/2 teaspoons pure all-natural almond extract

Place pears and granulated sugar in a medium saucepan. Pour in wine, then add enough water to cover the pears by at least 1/2 inch.
Simmer, uncovered, until pears can be easily pierced with the tip of a knife, but are not mushy, 10 to 15 minutes.
Strain pears, discarding the liquid, and set aside on a cutting board. Once completely cool, cut pears into thin slices.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line pans with 24 baking cups.
In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the pears, granulated sugar, and brown sugar, and mix on medium-low until well combined, about 1 minute.
With mixer running, slowly pour in the oil. Continue mixing until combined. Stop the mixer, remove the bowl and paddle, and use the paddle to scrape the insides of bowl, making sure everything is fully incorporated.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cardamom, and nutmeg and add to the batter. Reattach the bowl and paddle to the mixer, and mix on medium until just combined, then add eggs and continue mixing until the batter is homogenous, about 10 to 20 seconds. Remove the bowl and paddle from the mixer and, once again, use the paddle to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, ensuring that everything is well mixed.
Scoop cake batter into the prepared baking cups, filling them three quarters of the way.
Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. The cupcakes are done when the centers spring back when you touch them.
Remove the cupcakes from oven, and let cool completely while you make the almonds and buttercream. Leave the oven on.
Depending on the kind of pears you use, your cake batter may appear loose and watery. If this happens to you, add another 1/4 cup of flour, then allow cake to sit in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so to allow the batter to hydrate a bit before baking.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Using a sturdy chefs knife, roughly chop the almonds.
Place in a hot oven until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove the sheet from the oven, and immediately add the butter and salt. Gather up the corners of the aluminum foil, pinch to seal, then vigorously shake to coat the almonds. Set aside to cool.
Prepare the recipe for French Buttercream . Add the almond extract and beat well.
Fill a pastry bag fitted with a fluted tip with the almond buttercream, and pipe onto each pear cupcake.
Fan a few slices of pear across each cupcake. Sprinkle the chopped roasted almonds on top.

Original New York Cheesecake
1 recipe 9-inch Junior's Sponge Cake Crust
Four 8-ounce packages PHILADELPHIA cream cheese (use only full fat), at room temperature
1 2/3 cups sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 extra-large eggs
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 recipe 8-inch Junior's Sponge Cake Crust
Three 8-ounce packages PHILADELPHIA cream cheese (use only full fat), at room temperature
1 1/3 cups sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 extra-large eggs
2/3 cup heavy whipping cream

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make and bake the cake crust as directed and leave it in the pan. Keep the oven on.
2. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment if your mixer has one, beat 1 package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch together on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, beating well and scraping down the bowl after each.
3. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining sugar, then the vanilla. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the cream just until completely blended. The filling will look light, creamy, airy, and almost like billowy clouds. Be careful not to overmix! Gently spoon the batter over the crust.
4. Place the cake pan in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes halfway (about 1 inch) up the side of the springform. Bake until the edge is light golden brown, the top is light gold, and the center barely jiggles, about 1 1/4 hours. If the cake still feels soft around the edge, let it bake for 10 minutes more (the cooking time will be about the same for both the 8- and 9-inch cheesecakes). Remove the cheesecake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool for 2 hours (just walk awayâdon't move it). Then, leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely cold before serving, preferably overnight or for at least 6 hours.
5. Release and remove the side of the springform, leaving the cake on the bottom of the pan. Place on a cake plate. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Slice with a sharp straight-edge knife, not a serrated one, rinsing the knife with warm water between slices. Refrigerate any leftover cake, tightly covered, and enjoy within 2 days, or wrap and freeze for up to 1 month.

Sticky Toffee Pudding with Blood Orange, Tangerine, and Whipped CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che
1/2 pound whole Medjool dates, pitted and chopped
1 teaspoon baking soda
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup dark-brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 extra-large eggs
1 recipe Toffee Sauce
3 blood oranges
2 tangerines
6 kumquats
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons crÃ¨me fraÃ®che

Place the dates and baking soda in a bowl, and pour 1 cup boiling water over them. Let them sit for 1 hour, and then strain the dates (reserve the water). PurÃ©e them in a food processor, pour the liquid in, and pulse to combine.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Prepare a 9-inch springform pan by spreading butter on the inside surfaces, lining the bottom with parchment paper, and buttering the parchment.
Sift the flour and baking powder together. Stir in the salt.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars at medium-high speed for 4 to 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, and beat until fluffy again. Add the date purÃ©e and the flour mixture, alternating, to the butter mixture, and combine well.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 35 minutes, until the pudding is dark brown. Immediately after removing the pudding from the oven, pour 1/2 cup of toffee sauce over the top. Let the pudding rest for 15 minutes before serving.
While the pudding is baking, cut the stem and blossom ends from the blood oranges. Place the oranges cut-side down on a cutting board. Following the contour of the fruit with your knife, remove the peel and cottony white pith, working from top to bottom, and rotating the fruit as you go. Slice each orange into 8 to 10 pinwheels.
Peel the tangerines, separate them into segments, and remove all the white veins, or pith. Slice the kumquats into pinwheels. Chill the fruit until you are ready to serve.
Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or by hand), whip the cream and crÃ¨me fraÃ®che together to soft peaks.
Slice six pieces of warm pudding (the pudding serves twelve) and place them on six dessert plates. Spoon the rest of the warm toffee sauce over the slices. On each plate, dollop a heaping tablespoon of the whipped crÃ¨me fraÃ®che next to each piece and arrange the citrus evenly over and around the pudding. Scatter the kumquats in a beautiful natural style.

1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 large egg
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup mild-flavored (light) or robust-flavored (dark) molasses
1/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
Coarse sanding or raw sugar (for rolling)

Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk egg, butter, granulated sugar, molasses, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Mix in dry ingredients just to combine.
Place sanding sugar in a shallow bowl. Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls (if dough is sticky, chill 20 minutes). Roll in sugar and place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2 inch apart.
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and just set around edges (over-baked cookies won't be chewy), 8â10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.

Apple and Olive Oil Cake with Maple Icing
heaping 1/2 cup / 80 g raisins
4 tbsp water
2 1/4 cups / 280 g all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup / 120 ml olive oil
3/4 cup / 160 g superfine sugar
1/2 vanilla bean
2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
3 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 3/8-inch / 1-cm dice
grated zest of 1 lemon
2 free-range egg whites
confectioners' sugar for dusting (optional)
7 tbsp / 100 g unsalted butter, at room temperature
scant 1/2 cup / 100 g light muscovado sugar
scant 6 tbsp / 85 ml maple syrup
8 oz / 220 g cream cheese, at room temperature

1. Grease an 8-inch / 20-cm springform cake pan and line the bottom and sides with parchment paper. Place the raisins and water in a medium saucepan and simmer over low heat until all of the water has been absorbed. Leave to cool.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F / 170 degrees C. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and set aside.
3. Put the oil and superfine sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a whisk if you don't have a mixer). Slit the vanilla bean lengthwise in half and, using a sharp knife, scrape the seeds out into the bowl. Beat the oil, sugar, and vanilla together, then gradually add the eggs. The mix should be smooth and thick at this stage. Mix in the diced apples, raisins, and lemon zest, then lightly fold in the sifted dry ingredients.
4. Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl, either by hand or with a mixer, until they have a soft meringue consistency. Fold them into the batter in 2 additions, trying to maintain as much air as possible.
5. Pour the batter into the lined pan, level it with an icing spatula, and place in the oven. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the plan.
6. Once the cake is completely cold, you can assemble it. Remove from the pan and use a large serrated knife to cut it in half horizontally. You should end up with 2 similar disks. If the cake is very domed, you might need to shave a bit off the top half to level it.
7. To make the icing, beat together the butter, muscovado sugar, and maple syrup until light and airy. You can do this by hand, or preferably, in a mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the cream cheese and beat until the icing is totally smooth.
8. Using the icing spatula, spread a layer of icing 3/8 inch / 1 cm thick over the bottom half of the cake. Carefully place the top half on it. Spoon the rest of the icing on top and use the icing spatula to create a wavelike or any other pattern. Dust it with confectioners' sugar, if you like.

Thiebaud Pink Cake
1/2 pound (227 g) fresh strawberries
1/2 cup (4.3 oz / 120 g) water
1/4 cup (1.8 oz / 50 g) sugar
Rose's Downy Yellow Butter Cake
3/4 cup (6.4 oz / 180 g) Lemon Curd
Vanilla Buttercream
Simple Syrup
1 fresh raspberry

To make the strawberry concentrate, wash, dry, and hull the strawberries. Cut the berries in half or quarter them if they are especially big.
Combine the strawberries, water, and sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring to help the sugar dissolve. Turn down the heat to the low, cover, and simmer until the berries are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the berries rest, covered, for 5 minutes.
Transfer the berry mixture to a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium nonreactive saucepan. Once all of the juice has drained, set the berries aside to use in another project. Bring the juice to a simmer over medium-low heat until it has reduced down to 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g), about 10 minutes, and set aside to cool.
To assemble the pink cake, place the cooled cake on a flat, stable work surface. Using a long, serrated knife, slice off the rounded top of the cake so that it is perfectly level. An even, flat top is key to the look of this dessert.
Using the serrated knife, split the cake horizontally into 2 even layers. Split each half in half again so that you have a total of 4 layers. Place the bottom layer on an 8-inch cardboard cake round or directly on the serving platter and set on top of a cake turntable, if you have one. Generously brush the surface of the cake with simple syrup.
Prepare the buttercream by warming and whipping it to achieve a mayonnaise-like consistency (see Working with Buttercream ). Measure out 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream and, using an offset spatula, spread it evenly on the bottom cake layer, being careful not to let it blop over the sides. As you spread the buttercream, let a small wall (about 1/4 inch high) form around the outer edge, creating a well for the lemon curd.
Evenly distribute 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g) of the lemon curd in the well. Set another cake layer on top and brush with simple syrup; spread with buttercream, creating a well, and fill with lemon curd just as you did with the first layer. Repeat with the third layer. Top with the final cake layer.
If necessary, warm the buttercream once again. Measure out 1 cup (5.2 oz / 146 g) of buttercream and use the offset spatula to apply it as a crumb coat, a thin coating covering all surfaces of the cake; a crumb coat will seal the exterior of the cake to help prevent crumbs from marring the final frosting. (It's important to measure out buttercream specifically for the crumb coat so that the unused buttercream remains crumb free.) Refrigerate the cake for 10 to 15 minutes to set the crumb coat.
Reserve about 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream for the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, apply a thick layer of the remaining buttercream to the sides of the chilled crumb-coated cake. At this point, it's not important that the cake look prettyâit's most important that the buttercream be evenly distributed around the sides. With the cake sitting squarely in the middle of the turntable and with the offset spatula held vertically against the frosting, begin spinning the turntable. Keep the cake moving steadily in one direction and apply light pressure with the spatula; the buttercream will begin to even out. I like to imagine the spatula as the needle that stays steady while the record (or cake) spins round and round on the turntable. My goal is to make the sides perfect before adding any Thiebaud personality. Make sure to watch the vertical line of the cake; I find it helpful to look at the right side of the cake at eye level while spinning the turntable. You can add more buttercream to any spots that seem thin and whittle down any thick spots with the spatula.
Once the sides are perfectly vertical and smooth, create as much or as little texture as you want in the buttercream. I constantly refer back to Display Cakes as I try to capture the casual, slightly imperfect look of Thiebaud's cakes onto my neatly frosted sides. It's not easy! While spinning the cake on the turntable, I often hold my offset spatula vertically and gently wobble it back and forth, or I take a quick swipe at the cake with the spatula blade as the turntable spins.
When the sides are to your liking, you'll find a ring of buttercream standing up above the surface of the cake. Lightly  inchgrab inch the excess buttercream in one area with the offset spatula and pull it toward the center of the cake, spreading it toward the center. Repeat until you have a nice, clean edge all around.
If necessary, warm the reserved buttercream, and then mound it up on top of the cake in the center. Using a small offset spatula, start from the center and begin smoothing out the buttercream, inching it closer and closer to the edge of the cake. I work fairly slowly when doing this in order to get a nice, voluminous lip of buttercream where the sides and the top of the cake meet, re-creating the ring that appears around the top edge of Thiebaud's pink cake.
Place the raspberry in the center of the cake.
The cake is best served immediately.

Goat Cheese Cake with Mixed Berries
Unsalted butter (for pan)
3/4 cup sugar plus more for pan
12 ounces fresh soft goat cheese, room temperature
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 large eggs, separated
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 pints mixed berries (blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and/or raspberries)
A 9 inch-diameter springform pan

Preheat oven to 350 degrees . Butter springform pan and dust with sugar, tapping out any excess.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat goat cheese, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla, and 3/4 cup sugar in a large bowl until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks two at a time, beating to blend and scraping down sides of bowl between additions. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix just until blended.
Using clean, dry beaters, beat egg whites in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Fold 1/4 of egg whites into goat cheese mixture just until blended; fold in remaining egg whites just until blended. Scrape into prepared pan and tap pan to level batter.
Bake cheesecake until top is set but still jiggles slightly in the center, 30-35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool in pan.
Run a thin knife around sides of pan; unmold cake. Serve topped with berries.

July 4th Flag Cake
1 cup boiling water
3/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
1/2 cup whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional flour for dusting pan
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 sticks (1/2 pound) unsalted butter, softened, plus additional butter for greasing pan
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1 cup sugar
4 large eggs
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
2 sticks (1/2 pound) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1 1/2 pints raspberries (about 3 cups total)
1/2 pint blueberries (about 1 cup total)
Equipment: 13- by 9-inch metal baking pan, stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, pastry bag, star-shaped pastry tip (such as Wilton #2110)

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
Butter the bottom and sides of a 13- by 9-inch metal baking pan and line the bottom with wax or parchment paper. Butter the paper and dust the pan with flour, knocking out any excess.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the boiling water, cocoa powder, and instant coffee granules until smooth. Whisk in the milk and vanilla.
In a second medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars and beat on medium until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat on medium until fully incorporated. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour and cocoa powder mixtures in batches, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. (The batter may look curdled.) Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top, and bake the cake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then invert the cake onto the rack, remove the wax or parchment paper, and let it cool completely. DO AHEAD: The unfrosted cake, can be cooled, wrapped securely in plastic wrap, and stored at room temperature up to 24 hours, before assembling and serving.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese and butter and beat until creamy and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. With the mixer on low, add the sifted confectioners' sugar in three batches, mixing until fully incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is smooth. Chill the frosting in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before assembling the cake.
Frost the top and sides of the cake with 2 1/2 cups of the frosting. Transfer the remaining frosting to a pastry bag fitted with the star tip.
Using a toothpick or small knife, outline a 4 1/2-inch-long by 3 1/2-inch-wide rectangle in the top left corner of the cake. This area will be reserved for blueberries.
Starting with the longer side of the cake that is closest to you, pipe a line of frosting along the top edge of the cake then arrange two horizontal rows of raspberries directly above the line of frosting. Pipe a second line of frosting above the raspberries and arrange two more horizontal rows of raspberries directly above the frosting. Repeat this process two more times, making sure to exclude the top left corner that is reserved for the blueberries. Arrange the blueberries in horizontal rows in the top left corner of the cake.
Slice and serve the cake immediately or store it, covered securely in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

Strawberry Pazzo Cake with Herbed CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che
1 3/4 cups CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary leaves (or minced fresh basil leaves)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more to grease the pan
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt, preferably gray salt
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 pound fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
A few grinds of fresh black pepper
Confectioners' sugar for dusting, optional
1 cup Roasted Strawberries with syrup , optional

For the CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che: Stir together the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and the herbs. Refrigerate and let sit for 30 minutes or overnight.
For the Cake: Butter a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or 8-by-8-inch enameled cast-iron baking pan (if cooking in the grill) or standard 8-by-8-inch baking pan (if baking in your oven). (Don't put a standard baking pan inside your grill or over a fire.) Ignite the coals, turn a gas grill to high, or preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugars on medium speed until the mixture looks creamy, about 3 minutes. Slowly add the egg, milk, and vanilla and mix just until combined. Gradually add the flour mixture, mixing just until smooth with a creamy texture.
Pour the batter into the buttered pan. Arrange the strawberry halves, cut-side down, on top of the cake batter. Don't overlap the berries; use just enough strawberries for one layer and set aside the rest to use as garnish.
TO BAKE IN A GRILL: When the grill reaches 350 degrees F, slide in the cake, resting the pan on the grill rack, close the grill's lid and let it bake for at least 20 minutes with the grill lid closed. Test the cake: It's done when a skewer inserted into the center (but not in a strawberry) comes out clean and the cake is golden brown on top.
TO BAKE IN AN OVEN: Bake for 10 minutes and then decrease the heat to 325 degrees F and bake for an additional 45 to 50 minutes. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the center (but not in a strawberry) comes out clean and the cake is golden brown on top.
For the Glaze: While the cake is baking, in a small pan combine the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and black pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat and remove from the heat right away. Set it aside until the cake has baked. It should be the consistency of maple syrup; if it thickens too much before the cake comes out of the oven, stir in a few more spoonfuls of vinegar. As soon as the cake comes off the heat, drizzle the top with about three-fourths of the balsamic glaze.
When the cake has cooled, cut it into wedges if baked in a skillet; if baked in a standard baking pan, cut it into squares. To garnish simply, top with a light dusting of confectioners' sugar. To dress up the cake, spoon several tablespoons of the Roasted Strawberries onto one side of each plate; on the other side of the plate drizzle a small pool of the balsamic glaze, and smear it lightly with the back of a spoon. Drizzle more balsamic glaze over the cake if you like. Set a cake slice on top the strawberry syrup, and top the cake with a spoonful of Herbed CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che. Spoon any remaining crÃ¨me fraÃ®che into a bowl and set on a platter with leftover halved strawberries to pass so guests can add extra if they like.

Caramel Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pans
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups sugar
3 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup whole milk
1 1/2 cups whole milk
4 cups sugar
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) butter
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
Hot water

1 Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two round 9 by 2-inch cake pans. Pour about a tablespoon of flour into each of the pans and roll it around, tapping as you go, until the sides and bottom are covered completely with a thin layer of flour. Tip the pans, and tap out excess flour.
2 In a large mixing bowl, mix thoroughly with a whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.
3 In a separate large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until creamy, about 30 seconds. Add the sugar in 1/2-cup measures, beating about 15 seconds after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary, until the mixture has lightened in color and become fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, and the vanilla, beating for 15 seconds after each addition.
4 Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in thirds, alternating with additions of the milk. To avoid overmixing the batter, mix gently with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula after each addition, until the ingredient is just incorporated. Beat until all the ingredients have been incorporated, and then just a few strokes beyond. Divide the batter between the cake pans and spread the tops evenly.
5 Bake until a cake tester or toothpick emerges clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in their pans on a rack for 10 minutes, then slide a thin paring knife around the edge of the pans, and invert the cakes. Turn each cake again so its rounded top is facing up, and cool the cakes completely on the rack.
6 Make the icing: Pour the milk and 3 cups of the sugar into a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, mixing with a whisk. Add the butter and the salt, whisking occasionally until the butter melts. When mixture just simmers, cut the heat, but keep over the warm burner.
7 Pour the remaining 1 cup sugar into a saucepan. Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until it becomes a syrup, stirring every so often with a wooden spoon as it begins to brown, until the sugar syrup is evenly amber colored, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour the syrup into the warm milk mixture, being very careful, as the caramel will bubble and sputter when it hits the hot milk. Turn the heat beneath the pot to high and, whisking gently until all the syrup has completely dissolved into the roiling milk mixture, continue to cook to the soft-ball stage, about 238 degrees F; this may take 8 to 12 minutes.
8 Cut the heat beneath the caramel and gently whisk in the vanilla and the baking soda. Dip a spoon into the caramel, and let it cool to taste it. Season the caramel to taste with salt, and pour it into the bowl of a standing mixer (or use an electric hand-mixer and a large bowl). Beat on low speed as it cools, 15 to 20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen, until the icing is creamy and thick (between 100 degrees F and 105 degrees F). Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, until the icing is between 95 degrees F and 98 degrees Fâit should fall off your spatula in a ribbon that remains discernible on the surface of the icing for 10 seconds.
9 Set the first cake layer on a rack set over a sheet plan lined with waxed paper. Have an electric hand-mixer and the hot water nearby to blend a teaspoon or two into the icing if it becomes too thick to spread. Pour enough of the icing over the cake to cover the top in a layer about 1/4 inch thick (if it drips over the edge in places, that's fine; this is an early test of whether it's going to set in place or not). Top the first cake with the second cake layer and pour the rest of the icing in stages over the top of the cake, letting it run down the sides and using an icing spatula to guide the icing around the cake as it drips, until the entire cake is covered, for a traditional, classic look. (If you prefer the dramatic look of cake layers peeking out from behind a curtain of icing drips, by all means choose that route!) If you need to reuse any icing that overflows into the pan, simply move the cake on its rack temporarily, scrape up the icing from the waxed paper with a spatula and return it to the bowl, replace the rack over the pan, and continue to ice the cake.
10 Once the icing has set, using two spatulas carefully transfer the cake from the rack to a cake stand and let stand at room temperature beneath a cake dome until ready to serve. Only refrigerate if you plan to store the cake for more than 2 days.

Linda's Lemon Drizzle Cake
flour for dusting the pan
1 stick butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan
3/4 cup superfine sugar
2 large, free-range eggs, beaten
finely grated zest and juice of 3 lemons
1 1/2 cups all-purpose or light spelt flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, sifted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 9-inch non-stick loaf pan.
In a medium mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with a wooden spoon (or use an electric mixer). Gradually beat in the eggs and mix until light and fluffy. Stir in the lemon zest, flour, and baking powder, and mix well. Add 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice and mix well again. Then beat in the milk.
Pour the cake batter evenly into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45 minutes.
In the meantime, mix the remaining lemon juice and the confectioner's sugar together in a small bowl to make a glaze.
When it's ready, take the cake out of the oven and cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then turn it out onto a plate. Pierce the top of the cake all over with a thin skewer. Spoon the lemon glaze carefully and evenly over the cake until all of it is absorbed. Ready to eat.

Pistachio Shortbread
1 cup unsalted, shelled raw pistachios (about 4 1/2 ounces)
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract

Pulse pistachios in a food processor until finely ground but not a paste, about 30 seconds. Add flour, sugar, butter, salt, and vanilla; pulse until mixture is the consistency of cornmeal. With machine running, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water (a crumbly dough should form; do not overprocess).
Transfer dough to a sheet of parchment paper and pat into a rectangle. Top with another sheet of parchment and roll out to a 12x8 inch rectangle. Transfer dough (in parchment paper) to a baking sheet and chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Remove top sheet of parchment paper from dough and discard. Cut dough lengthwise into 8 equal strips, then each strip crosswise into quarters, forming 32 rectangles. Place rectangles on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.
Bake shortbread until golden brown, rotating sheets halfway through, 18-20 minutes. Transfer to wire racks; let cool.
DO AHEAD: Shortbread can be made 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

After the cake has cooled, slice in half horizontally and spread the bottom half with jam. Replace the top half and sprinkle superfine sugar over the top.

Tozzetti
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour plus more for work surface
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
2 large eggs
1 1/4 cups blanched almonds

Preheat oven to 325 degrees . Whisk baking powder, salt, and 1 3/4 cups flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer on medium-high, beat sugar and butter in a medium bowl until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping sides of bowl, until combined. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and mix just to blend. Fold in almonds.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead just to bring together, about 2 times. Form into a log about 14 inch long, 2 inch wide, and 1 inch thick. Place log on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Bake until puffed, cracked in spots, and starting to brown, 25-30 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack and let log cool.
Using a serrated knife, slice log diagonally 1/2 inch thick. Arrange slices on same sheet; bake until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Turn and bake until other side is golden brown, 5-10 minutes longer. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack. Let tozzetti cool.
DO AHEAD: Tozzetti can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Tiramisu Yule Log
1/2 cup sifted cake flour (not self-rising; sift before measuring), plus additional for dusting pan
5 large eggs, separated, left at room temperature for 30 minutes
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup espresso or very strong black coffee
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon Cognac or brandy
8 ounces mascarpone cheese
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon Cognac or brandy
1/2 cup chilled heavy cream
12 ounces 60% bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
3/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
Meringue mushrooms
Unsweetened cocoa for dusting
Confectioners' sugar for dusting
A 15- by 10- by 1-inch rimmed sheet pan (aka jelly-roll pan; small offset spatula (optional, but really helpful); long rectangular or oval platter or wooden serving board

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Butter pan and line bottom and sides with 1 sheet of parchment paper. Butter paper and dust with additional flour, knocking out excess.
Beat together yolks, vanilla, and 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until thick and pale and mixture forms a ribbon that takes 2 seconds to dissolve when beaters are lifted, 5 to 8 minutes in a stand mixer or 8 to 12 minutes with a handheld. Sift half of flour over yolks and fold it in gently but thoroughly, then sift and fold in remaining flour.
Beat whites with salt and cream of tartar in a large metal bowl with cleaned beaters at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Beat in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat until whites just hold stiff peaks.
Fold 1/4 of whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Stir 1/2 cup batter into melted butter in a small bowl until combined, then fold butter mixture into batter gently but thoroughly. Spread batter evenly in sheet pan and rap once on counter to help eliminate air bubbles.
Bake until top of cake springs back when gently pressed with finger, 7 to 10 minutes.
Sift top of hot cake evenly with confectioners' sugar and cover cake with a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) followed by a baking sheet. Holding sheet and cake pan together with oven mitts, flip cake onto cloth on baking sheet. Carefully peel off and discard parchment paper.
With a long side nearest you and using towel as an aid, roll up cake in towel, jelly-roll style, keeping it wrapped in towel. Cool cake completely, seam-side down in towel, on a rack.
Bring espresso and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves, then boil until reduced to a scant 1/4 cup. Remove pan from heat and stir in Cognac, then cool to room temperature.
Slowly mix mascarpone, sugar, cinnamon, and Cognac in a large bowl with an electric mixer until combined. If mixture is very loose after adding sugar, beat mixture briefly to thicken slightly (see Cooks' notes).
Beat heavy cream in another bowl with same beaters at medium speed until it just holds stiff peaks. Fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture.
Put chopped chocolate in a large bowl. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just comes to a boil, then pour over chocolate and let stand 3 minutes. Stir slowly with a whisk until smooth. If bits of chocolate remain unmelted, set bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and heat, stirring gently, until completely smooth, and remove from pan. Stir in corn syrup. Chill, stirring a couple of times, until it thickens to an easily spreadable consistency, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Gently unroll cooled cake on a baking sheet, keeping it on towel, then arrange baking sheet so that long side of cake that was inside roll is nearest to you. Brush all of cooled espresso syrup all over surface of cake. Spread filling with offset spatula evenly over cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around. Starting from long side nearest you, roll up cake without towel, leaving it seam-side down on baking sheet. Gently brush off any excess confectioners' sugar.
Cut a 1 1/2-inch-long diagonal slice from each end of roll and reserve. Transfer cake, using 2 metal slotted spatulas as aids, seam-side down on platter. Using ganache as  inchglue, inch attach end pieces, diagonal sides down, on top and side of log to resemble branches.
Spread ganache all over roll and branches with offset spatula, making it resemble tree bark (see Cooks' notes).
Arrange a few meringue mushrooms, if using, around Yule log, and very lightly sift a little cocoa over log and mushrooms first, followed by a little confectioners' sugar to resemble a light dusting of snow.

Porter Cake
3 1/2 cups (450g) all-purpose (plain) flour
1 teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (mixed spice)
1 teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
1 cup (225g) butter
1 cup packed (225g) light brown sugar
1 pound (450g) golden raisins (sultanas) or raisins or a mixture of both
3 ounces (75g) chopped candied peel, store-bought or homemade
2 eggs
1 (12-ounce/330ml) bottle porter or stout

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C/Gas mark 4). Line the sides and bottom of an 8-inch (20 cm) high-sided round cake pan (the sides should be about 2 3/4 inches/7 cm high) with waxed (greaseproof) paper.
Sift the flour, nutmeg, spice, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter, then stir in the brown sugar, raisins, and candied peel.
Whisk the eggs in another bowl and add the porter. Pour into the dry ingredients and mix well. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for about 2 hours. If the cake starts to brown too quickly on top, cover it with aluminum foil or waxed (greaseproof) paper after about 1 hour. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to sit in the pan for about 20 minutes before turning it out and cooling it on a wire rack.

Coconut Macaroon Sandwiches with Lime Curd
1 (14-ounce) bag (5 1/3 cups) sweetened flaked coconut
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 large egg whites
1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract
1 tablespoon lime zest
3/4 cup fresh lime juice (from about 6 limes)
3/4 cup sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
4 large egg yolks
1 drop green food coloring, if desired
Edible gold or silver glitter or clear sanding sugar (optional)
Small offset spatula (optional, but very helpful); edible gold or silver glitter; a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag (not pleated)

Heat oven to 325 degrees F with racks in upper and lower third. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Stir together coconut, sugar, flour, and salt until combined well, then add egg whites and almond extract and stir until combined well.
Pack dough in a teaspoon measure, preferably with offset spatula, scraping it level, then use spatula to remove dough from teaspoon in a single mound. Arrange mounds, rounded side up, 1 inch apart, on baking sheets.
Bake until just springy to the touch and bottoms are pale golden, 8 to 12 minutes, switching position of sheets halfway through baking.
Remove cookies from oven and sprinkle while still hot with edible glitter, if using. Cool cookies on baking sheet 1 minute, and transfer to racks to cool completely.
Whisk together lime zest and juice, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan until cornstarch is dissolved, then whisk in butter. Bring to a simmer over moderately high heat, whisking constantly, then reduce heat and continue to simmer briskly, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Remove pan from heat.
Lightly beat yolks in a small bowl, then slowly add 1/4 cup lime mixture, whisking. Add yolk mixture to remaining lemon mixture, whisking, then cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until curd is thick enough to hold marks of whisk, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, then cover surface with wax paper and chill until cold, about 1 hour.
Transfer lime curd to plastic bag and press out excess air. Snip a 1/8-inch opening in bottom corner of bag, then twist bag firmly just above curd.
Put 1 cookie, flat side up, on work surface and pipe about 1/2 teaspoon lime curd onto cookie, then top with another cookie, flat side down, to form a sandwich. Make more sandwiches in same manner.

Salted Brown Butter Cookies
1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 (1-pound) box confectioners' sugar
4 teaspoons powdered egg whites (not reconstituted), such as Just Whites, or meringue powder (see Cooks' notes)
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla
Decorative sugars and or salts, if desired
Wax paper and parchment paper; rolling pin rings (optional, but really helpful; see Cooks' notes:); 3- to 4-inch holiday cookie cutters; several small, heavy-duty sealable plastic bags (not pleated), if icing cookies

Melt butter in a 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, then cook over low heat, swirling pan occasionally, until butter has a nutty aroma and is a rich brown color, and bottom of pan is speckled with browned bits of the milk solids, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, including browned milk solids on bottom, and chill until almost firm, about 30 minutes.
Whisk together flour and cornstarch in a bowl. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, then beat in egg, salt, and vanilla. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined well.
Form dough into 2 balls and flatten each into a 6-inch disk. Chill disks, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firmer, but not hard, 15 to 30 minutes.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle position. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out 1 disk of dough (keep remaining dough chilled) between 2 large sheets of wax paper 1/8 inch thick (this is when the rolling pin rings are really helpful). Freeze or chill dough on a baking sheet or tray until firm, 5 to 15 minutes, then cut out as many cookies as possible from dough. Transfer cookies to lined baking sheet, arranging cookies about 1 inch apart. If the cookies become too warm to transfer, freeze or chill until firm (see Cooks' notes).
Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely.
Meanwhile, gather scraps of dough and repeat cookie process above. Parchment can be reused, but make sure baking sheet cools between batches. Make more cookies with remaining dough.
Beat together all ingredients in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until just combined, about 1 minute.
Increase speed to high and continue to beat until icing holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 minutes with a handheld. If not using icing immediately, cover surface with a dampened paper towel, then cover bowl with plastic wrap.
Transfer icing to a heavy-duty resealable bag and press out excess air. Snip a 1/8-inch opening in bottom corner of bag, then twist bag firmly just above icing and decoratively pipe icing onto cookies. If desired, sprinkle with sanding sugars or colorful sea salts while icing is still wet. (For tinted icing, see Cooks' notes.)
Let icing dry completely (about 1 hour) before storing cookies.

Salty Chocolate Chunk Cookies
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar
2 large egg yolks
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (do not exceed 72% cacao), coarsely chopped
Maldon or other flaky sea salt

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Whisk flour, baking powder, kosher salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl; set aside.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar, sugar, and powdered sugar until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add egg yolks, egg, and vanilla. Beat, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until mixture is pale and fluffy, 4-5 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low; slowly add dry ingredients, mixing just to blend. Using a spatula, fold in chocolate.
Spoon rounded tablespoonfuls of cookie dough onto 2 parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Sprinkle cookies with sea salt.
Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until just golden brown around the edges, 10-12 minutes (the cookies will firm up as they cool). Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks; let cool completely. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Stage Planks
3-3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup buttermilk
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, sift together 3 cups flour, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In bowl of a standing mixer, add molasses, sugar, and butter. Mix on medium-high speed until color turns lighter, about 2 minutes. On low mixer speed, alternate flour and buttermilk with butter mixture. Raise speed to medium and mix 30 seconds. Dough should be stiff enough to roll out. If not, mix in up to 1/2 cup more flour to reach proper consistency.
On a hard floured surface, roll dough to a 10 inch x 16 inch rectangle. Slice down the middle horizontally, then vertically at 2-inch intervals to make 16 cookies. Place individual pieces at least 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake until tops are firm, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely in pans.

Pecan Sandies for My Mom
1 3/4 cups + 1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour (250 grams)
3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans (80 grams)
6 ounces (170 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup + 1 3/4 teaspoons powdered sugar (90 grams)
Additional powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

Position the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (convection) or 350 degrees F (standard). Line two sheet pans with Silpats or parchment paper.
Toss the flour and pecans together in a medium bowl.
Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium-low speed until smooth. Add the 90 grams/3/4 cup plus 1 3/4 teaspoons powdered sugar and mix for about 2 minutes, until fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed for about 30 seconds, until just combined. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to incorporate any dry ingredients that have settled there.
Divide the dough into 30-gram/1 1/2-tablespoon portions, roll into balls, and arrange on the sheet pans, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between them. Press the cookies into 2-inch disks.
Bake until pale golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes if using a convection oven, 22 to 25 minutes if using a standard oven, reversing the positions of the pans halfway through. (Sandies baked in a convection oven will not spread as much as those baked in a standard oven and will have a more even color.)
Set the pans on a cooling rack and cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely.
If desired, dust with powdered sugar.
The cookies can be stored in a covered container for up to 3 days.

Tuckers
2 1/2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut
4 large egg whites
2/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon food-grade pure rose extract (not rose water); optional
Red liquid food coloring
White sanding sugar
Ingredient info: Unsweetened shredded coconut is sold at natural foods stores. Rose extract is available at surlatable.com. Look for sanding sugar at specialty foods stores.

Cook first 3 ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture is hot, dry to the touch, and starts pulling away from sides of pan, about 10 minutes.
Scrape dough into a heatproof bowl. Stir in vanilla and rose extract, if using. Add 1 drop of food coloring; stir well. Press plastic wrap on top of dough. Chill for at least 5 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and stack it on top of a second sheet (this keeps cookie bottoms from browning too quickly).
Roll 1 tablespoon of dough into a ball. With your fingers, pinch the ball to form a 3-sided pyramid that ends in a point. Dip into white sanding sugar.
Bake cookies until lightly golden on top and slightly firm to the touch, 25-30 minutes. Let cool on sheet on a wire rack. DO AHEAD: Tuckers can be made 3 days ahead. Store cookies airtight at room temperature.

Speculoos Buttons
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons mild-flavored (light) molasses
1 large egg, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg white
Sanding or other decorative sugar
2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
Sprinkles, colored sanding sugar, or dragÃ©es (optional)

Whisk first 6 ingredients in a medium bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter in a medium bowl until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add both sugars and molasses; continue to beat until mixture is smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg and vanilla; mix for 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low; add dry ingredients and mix to blend well.
Scrape dough from bowl and divide into thirds. Using your palms, roll each piece of dough into an 8 inch log. Wrap logs tightly in plastic or parchment paper and freeze for at least 3 hours. (For neater edges, remove logs from freezer after 1 hour and roll on counter.) DO AHEAD: Dough can be made up to 2 months ahead. Keep frozen.
Arrange racks in top and bottom thirds of oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Whisk egg white in a small bowl to loosen; lightly brush all over 1 log. Sprinkle with (or roll in) sanding sugar. Using a long, slender knife, slice off a sliver of dough from each end of log to make ends flat. Cut log into 1/4 inch-thick rounds. Transfer to 1 baking sheet, spacing 1/2 inch apart; place in freezer while you cut the next log. (The cookies hold their shape better if you bake when dough is cold.) Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake 2 sheets of cookies, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and front to back after 6 minutes, until tops are golden brown and centers are almost firm, 11-13 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool. Repeat with third sheet of cookies. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
Mix powdered sugar and 7 teaspoons cold water in a large mixing bowl (glaze will be very thick). Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon glaze onto each button (alternatively, fill a resealable plastic bag with glaze and cut a small hole in 1 corner; pipe glaze in an even circle around edges of cookies, then fill). Decorate with sprinkles, colored sugar, or dragÃ©es, if desired. Let stand on rack at room temperature for at least 30 minutes for glaze to set. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Merveilles
1 cup all-purpose flour plus more for dusting
1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature
1 large egg, room temperature, beaten to blend
2 tablespoons brandy or dark rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Vegetable, grapeseed, or sunflower oil (for frying)
Powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar (for dusting)
A deep-fry thermometer

Whisk 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Blend sugar and zest in a medium bowl with your fingertips until sugar is fragrant. Add butter; use a spatula to blend. Add egg, brandy, and vanilla; stir to blend. Add dry ingredients; stir until a moist dough forms. Transfer to a sheet of plastic; wrap tightly and chill for at least 2 hours and preferably overnight.
Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Cut dough in half. Generously flour work surface (the dough is sticky). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time (chill remaining dough), dust top with more flour and roll out, turning occasionally to make sure it's not sticking; roll out dough as thinly as possible, turning and dusting with flour as needed.
Working with a zigzag pastry or ravioli cutter, a plain pizza wheel, or a long knife, cut dough into long strips, squares, diamonds, or shape of your choice. Place strips on prepared baking sheet; cover with another piece of plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining dough. Chill for at least 1 hour.
Pour oil into a deep saucepan to a depth of 4 inch. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan; heat oil to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with several layers of paper towels.
Drop 4-6 pieces of dough into pan and fry until golden on both sides, 2-3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs and allowing excess oil to drip back into pan, transfer cookies to prepared sheet to drain. Pat tops with more paper towels to blot oil. While cookies are still hot, dust both sides with powdered or cinnamon sugar. Repeat with remaining dough, returning oil to 350 degrees F between batches.
Just before serving, dust Merveilles with more sugar.

Chocolate-Covered Pumpkin Cheesecake Pops
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg
1 cup canned pure pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 pound bittersweet chocolate (60% cacao), chopped
2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs
9-inch glass pie plate; 1 1/2-inch-diameter ice cream scoop, holding about 1 tablespoon; 24 (6- to 8-inch) lollipop sticks (see Cooks' notes)

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Oil pie plate.
Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy and smooth, then beat in egg until combined. Add pumpkin, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice and mix on low speed until smooth.
Pour batter into pie plate and bake until edges are set and center is still a little wobbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack to let cool completely. (Cheesecake will set completely as it cools.)
Cover cheesecake with a round of wax paper or parchment then wrap in plastic and chill until cold, at least 3 hours.
Scoop out pumpkin cheesecake, packing cheesecake in ice cream scoop each time and leveling it off, then releasing it, flat side down, onto 2 small, wax paper-lined rimmed baking sheets. Freeze until frozen solid, at least 1 hour.
Melt half of chocolate in a small, deep bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, then remove bowl from pan.
Working with one pan of cheesecake balls at a time (and keeping the other pan frozen), rest a cheesecake scoop on a fork and lower it into chocolate, then spoon chocolate over it to coat it completely. Let excess chocolate drip off, then scrape bottom of fork against edge of bowl and return coated ball, flat-side down, to wax paper-lined pan. Sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs and push a lollipop stick 3/4 inch through ball. Repeat with remaining balls on first baking sheet. (If cheesecake begins to soften, return to freezer to harden.) Refrigerate finished pops.
Melt remaining chocolate in another small deep bowl in same manner and coat remaining cheesecake balls.
Keep pops refrigerated or frozen until serving.

Spritz Cookies
2 1/4 cups/315 g Jeanne's Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup/225 g unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup/100 g granulated sugar
1 extra-large egg, plus egg yolk, at room temperature
3/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
Colored sugar for sprinkling (optional)
1 cup/170 g semisweet chocolate chips (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C/gas mark 4. Have ready two ungreased cookie sheets.
In a small bowl, mix together the flour and salt.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until light, about 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and beat for 1 minute. Add the whole egg and egg yolk and beat for 1 minute. Add the vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour mixture, and beat until combined.
Here comes the fun part. Prepare your cookie press by placing the plunger on the tube part and turn to lock. Lift the plunger until it's all the way at the top. Then fill the tube with the dough from the bottom opening. Fit the disk of your choice into the bottom ring and screw on tightly. Now press the gun part (it will click each time you press the handle) until you see dough just pushing against the disk at the bottom.
Now you're ready to press out dough. Place the end of the press firmly and evenly against a cookie sheet and press once on the gun. Lift the press. If the dough was adequately pressed against the disk, you should have a nice cookie shape on the sheet. If dough came out but did not stick, or if the shape is wonky, pick up the dough and put it back into the bowl (I told you this would be easy). Press out enough cookies to cover the cookie sheets, spacing them about 1 1/2 in/4 cm apart. Lightly sprinkle with colored sugar (if using). I usually sprinkle some with colored sugar and leave some plain.
Bake until the cookies are light brown on the bottoms, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Repeat the process with the remaining dough, allowing the cookie sheets to cool completely. If the dough starts to seem too squishy to make defined shapes, refrigerate it for a few minutes.
If you like melt the chocolate chips in a small saucepan over extremely low heat until just barely melted. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Remove from the heat and whisk until smooth. Line a cookie sheet with waxed paper. With a butter knife, spread a bit of melted chocolate on the bottoms of some of the cookies and press the cookies, chocolate-side down, onto the waxed paper. For sandwich cookies, spread melted chocolate on the bottom of a cookie and press the bottom of another cookie of the same shape onto the chocolate. Or drizzle melted chocolate on top of the shapes. Be creative! Let the cookies sit for about 1 hour to let the chocolate set.
Store in an airtight container, with waxed paper between the layers, at room temperature for up to 7 days.

Shortbread
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
3/4 cup flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup sugar
Pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Green sanding or decorating sugar

1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and lightly grease an 8-inch round cake tin.
2 Put the butter in a medium bowl and use a hand mixer to beat until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and mix to combine. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan, smoothing the surface with your fingertips, and chill for 10 minutes in the refrigerator.
3 Sprinkle generously with the green sugar and bake for 15 minutes, until just turning golden brown. While still warm, cut into 16 wedges with the tip of a paring knife. Let cool completely before removing from pan.

Pistachio Cranberry Oatmeal Icebox Cookies
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup roasted and salted shelled pistachios (about 5 ounces)
1 cup dried cranberries (about 4 ounces)
4 ounces bittersweet or white chocolate, melted (see Cooks' notes)
A sharp serrated knife; a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag (not pleated)

Beat together butter and sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, then beat in baking powder and soda, spices, and salt until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla and beat well.
Add flour and mix on low speed until just combined well. Stir in oats, pistachios, and cranberries.
Divide dough in quarters. Shape each quarter on a large sheet of wax paper, using paper as an aid, into a 9-inch-long log, and wrap up tightly in paper first, then in plastic wrap, twisting ends (like a piece of hard candy). Chill until firm, at least 4 hours.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Work with 1 log at a time, keeping remaining log chilled. If log softens as you work with it, rewrap it and chill or freeze it until firm. Using serrated knife, cut a 1/4-inch-thick slice from log with a sawing motion and place on baking sheet. Continue cutting, arranging slices as cut about 2 inches apart on sheet.
Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden and set, 8 to 10 minutes total. Cool cookies on baking sheets 1 minute before transferring to racks to cool completely. (Parchment can be reused, but cool baking sheets between batches.)
If garnishing with a drizzle of melted chocolate, finely chop the chocolate then melt it in microwave at 50 percent power for 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Or, melt the chopped chocolate in a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water.
Cool chocolate slightly, then put in plastic bag and press out excess air. Snip a tiny opening in bottom corner of bag, then twist bag firmly just above chocolate and drizzle over cookies on racks set over wax paper or a pan. Let cookies stand at cool room temperature until chocolate is set.

Using your fingertips, mix remaining ingredients in a medium bowl until mixture holds together when pinched tightly. Pack onto bottom of pan in an even layer (using the bottom of a flat measuring cup works well). Chill until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.
Place gelatin and 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water in a heatproof bowl. Let stand until softened, 5-10 minutes.
Pulse cream cheese, yogurt, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt in a food processor, scraping down sides as needed, until completely smooth.
Pour water to a depth of 1/2 inch into a small skillet over medium heat. Place bowl with gelatin in skillet; stir until gelatin dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove bowl from skillet.
With processor running, drizzle gelatin into cream cheese mixture; mix until well blended. Pour into prepared crust. Tap pan firmly on the counter to break up any big air bubbles. Smooth top. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and chill for at least 6 hours before serving. DO AHEAD: Cheesecake can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Bring first 3 ingredients to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer, whisking occasionally, until syrup is thickened, shiny, and measures a generous 1/2 cup, 35-40 minutes. Let cool. DO AHEAD: Pomegranate syrup can be made 5 days ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm slightly before serving.
Cut cheesecake into slices, dipping knife into a large glass of warm water and wiping dry between slices, and place on plates. Drizzle pomegranate syrup over and scatter pomegranate seeds around.

Bacon-Fat Gingersnaps
3/4 cup bacon fat (from 1 1/2 to 2 pounds bacon), at room temperature
1 cup sugar, plus 1/4 cup for rolling
1/4 cup molasses (not blackstrap) or cane syrup, such as Steen's or Lyle's
1 large egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Combine all the ingredients in a food processor, and pulse until a smooth, stiff dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for a few hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Put the 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow bowl. Breaking off 1-tablespoon lumps, roll the dough into balls, drop into the sugar, roll to coat, and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are dark brown. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

1-2-3-4 cake
Softened butter and flour, for the pans
N/A and flour
3 cups sifted cake flour (not self-rising)
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon plain salt
1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 cups sugar
4 large eggs, separated, at room temperature
1 cup whole milk, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
3/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest

Butter and flour the bottom and sides of three 8 by 1 1/2-inch cake pans with the softened butter, tipping out the excess flour.
Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until it is light, creamy, and fluffy, about 1 minute. Gradually add the sugar into the butter, and beat until the mixture is very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes more. As the sugar blends in it will change the color of the butter to a much lighter color, almost white.
Whisk the egg yolks in a small bowl until they are well blended. Gradually beat into the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition. With the mixer on low speed, starting with the flour mixture, add the flour mixture in thirds, alternating with two equal additions of the milk, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. In a clean bowl using clean beaters beat the egg whites until they form firm, glossy peaks. Do not overbeat until they are stiff and dry. Fold the whites into the batter.
Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pans, dividing it equally among them. Give the filled pans a little knock on the countertop to level the batter. Bake in the center of a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 25 minutes, or until each cake springs back when touched in the center. Remove the pans from the oven and put them on wire cake racks to cool for a few minutes, then loosen the layers by running the flat side of a knife blade around the sides of the pans, put a rack on top of each pan, and invert so the cake comes out onto the rack, top side down. Then reverse the layers so they are top side up.
Mix the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar, and orange rind together and drizzle the mixture over the still warm cake layers, being careful not to let it all soak into one spot; then pile the layers on top of each other. Let the cake cool.

Rugelach Three Ways
1 cup (2 sticks) parve margarine
8 ounces parve cream cheese, softened
2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling out dough
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
4 ounces parve chocolate chips
6 tablespoons parve whipping cream
1/4 pecan halves (optional)
1 cup apricot jam or preserves
4 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup sweet orange marmalade
1/3 cup pine nuts

1. To make the dough: Place the margarine, cream cheese, flour, and confectioners' sugar in the bowl of a mixer or food processor fitted with a metal blade or stand mixer with a paddle and mix just until dough comes together. You can also mix the dough together by hand with a wooden spoon in a large bowl.
2. Divide the dough in half and wrap each ball in plastic and flatten. Freeze 1 1/2 hours or overnight and then remove from freezer half an hour before using. The dough is ready to be rolled when you can press gently into it. If it gets too soft, put it back in the freezer to firm up.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
4. To roll out the rugelach, place a large sheet of parchment on the counter. Sprinkle some flour on the parchment, place one of the dough discs on the parchment, sprinkle again with flour, and then top with a second sheet of parchment. Rolling on top of the parchment, roll out the dough to 13 x 10 inches. Peel back the top parchment once or twice while rolling and sprinkle some more flour on the dough. Remove the top parchment but reserve for re-use. This portion of the dough is now ready to be filled with one of three fillings, or another filling of your choice.
5. After filling the dough, Fold the right and left sides (the short sides) of the dough 1/2 inch in toward the center to keep the filling inside. Using the parchment to help you, roll the long side from the top toward you, working slowly and rolling as tightly as you can.
6. Place the parchment you used on top of the dough when rolling it to line a cookie sheet. Place the loaf on the cookie sheet with the seam on the bottom and flatten slightly. Repeat for the other loaf.
7. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top begins to brown. Let cool and then slice into 1-inch pieces. These can be frozen. I prefer to freeze the baked loaves and then slice them when ready to serve.
Melt the chocolate chips on the stovetop or in the microwave, mixing often until the chocolate is smooth. Remove from heat, add cream, and mix well. If using pecans, place them in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin. Spread the chocolate mixture evenly on the dough all the way to the edges and then sprinkle with pecan pieces.
Spread half the apricot jam or preserves evenly on the dough. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and then sprinkle half on top of the jam.
Spread the orange marmalade over the dough and sprinkle on the pine nuts.

Salted Rye Cookies
1 cup (2 sticks / 225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar
1 large egg
Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
2 1/2 cups (230 g) whole (dark) rye flour
3 tablespoons coarse sparkling sugar or turbinado sugar

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream the butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, a pinch of salt, and the orange zest. Gradually mix in the flour. Divide the dough into two portions and place each on a sheet of plastic wrap. Shape into logs about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter and wrap tightly. To shape the soft dough log into a more perfect cylinder, use a paper-towel tube: Cut the tube open vertically along one side and nest the wrapped log inside, then tape or rubber-band the tube closed. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
On a sheet of waxed paper, combine 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the sparkling sugar. Unwrap the dough logs and roll them in the mixture to coat well. Place each log on a cutting board and cut into 1/8-inch-thick (3-mm-thick) rounds, arranging the rounds 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned at the edges, about 16 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through so the cookies bake evenly. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. The cookies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

Black Forest Cake
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for buttering cake pan
1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for dusting cake pan
1/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa
Pinch of salt
6 large eggs, at room temperature
3/4 cup (4 3/4 ounces) superfine sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup sugar
1 ounce (2 tablespoons) kirsch
4 cups heavy cream
1 cup (4 ounces) powdered sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups Spirited Sour Cherries , drained, or a 24-ounce jar sour cherries such as morello or amarena
jar sour cherries such as morello or amarena
8 fresh cherries with stems (optional)
About 2 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (at least 60% cacao) in a single block
About 1/2 cup ground dark chocolate (at least 60% cacao) or chocolate cookie crumbs
Powdered sugar for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees . Place the rack in the center of the oven. Butter and flour a 10-inch cake pan that is 3 inches deep such as a springform mold.
Sift the 1/2 cup flour, the cocoa, and the salt together onto a sheet of parchment paper and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla at high speed until the mixture has tripled in volume and is very thick, about 8 minutes. When the whisk is lifted, the batter will form a thick ribbon as it falls back into the bowl.
Lower the speed to stir and carefully tap the dry ingredients into the egg mixture. As soon as all the flour has been added to the eggs, stop the machine. Pour in the melted butter, making sure to leave the white, milky solids behind. With a large rubber spatula, using as few strokes as possible, finish folding the flour mixture and butter into the batter until evenly mixed.
Immediately scrape the batter into the prepared pan, place the pan on a baking sheet, and bake until the cake feels just firm to the touch, about 40 minutes. Transfer the cake to a rack and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then turn the cake upside down onto a rack to cool. This will flatten the slightly domed top.
Place the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the kirsch and remove from the heat. Pour the syrup into a small cup or bowl and set it aside.
In a large bowl, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until it holds firm peaks. Do not overbeat; the whipped cream should be smooth and firm. Divide the cream into 4 equal portions and set them aside. (This helps prevent getting to the last bit of decorating and discovering you have run out of cream.) Drain the cherries and divide them into 2 equal piles. Reserve 8 to 12 cherries to garnish the top of the cake if you do not have fresh cherries.
Place the cake on a work surface with its original top up. Trim off any hard crusts. With a long serrated knife, cut the cake horizontally into 3 even layers. Transfer the top layer to a serving plate, arranging it top side down. Brush it liberally with the syrup. With an offset spatula or rubber spatula, smooth on a 1/2-inch layer of whipped cream. Push the cream a little beyond the edge of the cake. (This prevents gaps when you settle the next layer on top.) Nestle half of the cherries into the whipped cream, scattering them evenly over the top.
Place the middle cake layer on top of the cherries, pressing it lightly into the whipped-cream layer. Brush with syrup, spread with whipped cream, and scatter the remaining half of the cherries over the cream.
Finally, add the last cake layer, cut side up, on top of the cherries, again settling it into the whipped-cream layer. Brush with syrup. With an icing spatula or a large rubber spatula, spread a thin layer of whipped cream over the top of the cake. Spread a thicker layer onto the sides.
Pastry shops add a decorative scalloped edge of ground dark chocolate around the base of the cake. Fill your cupped palm with some of the ground chocolate and lift and tilt it onto the base of the cake all around the bottom edge. Rotate the cake between handfulls. It's the heel of your hand that forms the scalloped edge.
Rotate the edge of a sharp knife against the block of chocolate to make curls or cut shavings with a vegetable peeler. Pile them on top of the cake.
Scoop the remaining whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Pipe fat rosettes all around the top edge of the cake. Press a fresh or spirited cherry into the center of each rosette. Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours to let the flavors meld. Just before serving, dust the top with powdered sugar.
Use about 24 ounces of preserved sour cherries in syrup. Drain the cherries, reserving the syrup and cherries separately. In a small saucepan, bring to a boil 1/3 cup espresso or strong coffee, the reserved syrup, and 3/4 cup sugar (or to taste), stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and reserve until needed.
For our Christmas menu in 2010, we used Black Forest flavors for our bÃ»che de NoÃ«l. We baked the gÃ©noise as a sheet cake, soaked it with the kirsch syrup, spread it thickly with the whipped cream, and then scattered the cherries over the cream before rolling up the cake. We iced it with the traditional chocolate buttercream. This makes a lighter-than-usual bÃ»che, and our guests cleaned their plates.

Spice Cookies
3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp / 125 g currants
2 tbsp brandy
scant 2 cups / 240 g all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp best-quality cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp each ground cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
5 oz / 150 g good-quality dark chocolate, coarsely grated
1/2 cup / 125 g unsalted butter, at room temperature
2/3 cup / 125 g superfine sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp grated lemon zest
1/2 tsp grated orange zest
1/2 large free-range egg
1 tbsp diced candied citrus peel
3 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 1/3 cups / 160 g confectioners' sugar

Soak the currants in the brandy for 10 minutes. Mix together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, spices, salt, and dark chocolate. Mix well with a whisk.
Put the butter, sugar, vanilla, and lemon and orange zest in a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment and beat to combine but not aerate much, about 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly add the egg and mix for about 1 minute. Add the dry ingredients, followed by the currants and brandy. Mix until everything comes together.
Gently knead the dough in the bowl with your hands until it comes together and is uniform. Divide the dough into 1 3/4-oz / 50g chunks and shape each chunk into a perfectly round ball. Place the balls on 1 or 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 3/4 inch / 2 cm apart, and let rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190 degrees C. Bake the cookies for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top firms up but the center is still slightly soft. Remove from the oven. Once the cookies are out of the oven, allow to cool for only 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack. While the cookies are still warm, whisk together the glaze ingredients until a thin and smooth icing forms. Pour 1 tablespoon of the glaze over each biscuit, leaving it to drip and coat the biscuit with a very thin, almost transparent film. Finish each with 3 pieces of candied peel placed at the center. Leave to set and serve, or store in an airtight container for a day or two.

Continue to bake until top is golden brown and cake springs back when pressed, 20-25 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack. Let cool slightly in pan. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Strawberry Buckle with Lemon-Pistachio Streusel
6 tablespoons (3 oz / 85 g) cold unsalted butter
1 cup (4.9 oz / 140 g) all-purpose flour
1/2 cup (3.5 oz / 100 g) sugar
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
1/2 cup (2.7 oz / 76 g) unsalted shelled pistachios, coarsely chopped
1 cup (4.9 oz / 140 g) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
11 tablespoons (5.5 oz / 156 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup (5.3 oz / 150 g) sugar
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 eggs (3.5 oz / 100 g), at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup (4.7 oz / 133 g) strawberries, cut into bite-sized pieces

TO MAKE THE STREUSEL, cut the butter into small chunks and let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and zest. Add the butter and mix on low speed until the mixture resembles coarse beach sand, about 2 minutes. Add the pistachios and mix just until the streusel begins to clump together and look like gravel, being careful not to let it come together to form a dough. If not using the streusel right away, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
TO MAKE THE CAKE, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour the bottom and sides of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan.
Sift the flour and baking powder into a small bowl.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on low speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sugar and salt and mix on low speed until well combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then mix on medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine the eggs and the vanilla extract and whisk vigorously until well blended.
With the mixer on medium speed, add the egg mixture very slowly, in a steady stream, and mix until well-incorporated and very smooth, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then mix on medium speed for 30 more seconds.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the flour mixture. Mix on low speed just until uniform in texture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the fruit until evenly incorporated.
TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE, pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth it with an offset or rubber spatula, and sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the streusel is dry and golden and the buckle is firm and springs back when gently pressed in the center, rotating the pan midway through the baking time.
Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then remove from the pan. Serve warm or at room temperature. Stored in a covered container at room temperature, it will keep for up to 3 days.

Plum and Polenta Cake

Beurre & Sel Jammers
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt
2 large egg yolks, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
5 1/2 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup thick jam, such as lingonberry, apricot, orange marmalade, and blackberry
A 2 inch cookie cutter; 3 standard 12-cup muffin tins

Using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter in a large bowl until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add both sugars and salt; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low; beat in egg yolks and vanilla. Add flour and mix just to combine. Dough will be soft and slightly sticky.
Divide dough in half. Place each half between sheets of parchment or waxed paper. Flatten dough into disks. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough, occasionally lifting paper on both sides for easy rolling, until 1/4 inch thick. Freeze dough in paper until firm, at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.
Mix flour, sugar, and salt in a small mixing bowl. Using your fingertips, rub butter and vanilla into dry ingredients until no large lumps remain and butter is well incorporated. Streusel will be sandy and hold its shape when pressed between your fingers. Cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Streusel can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Arrange a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F.
Using cookie cutter, cut out rounds of frozen dough from freezer. Place rounds in bottom of muffin cups and gently pat to flatten. Continue cutting frozen dough into rounds; gather scraps and repeat process of rolling out and cutting to make 34 rounds. Cover muffin tins with foil and chill in freezer until dough is firm, about 30 minutes or up to 2 days.
Spoon about 1 teaspoon jam into the center of each round of dough. Using your fingers or a small spoon, sprinkle 1-1 1/2 tablespoons streusel around edges of each cookie, trying not to get any in the jam.
Bake cookies, in batches if needed, until sides and streusel are golden, 20-22 minutes. Let cool in tins for 15 minutes. Run a small knife around edges of muffin cups; gently remove cookies and let cool completely on a wire rack. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Rugelach
2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon-size pats
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1 pound cream cheese, chilled
1/4 cup sour cream
2 cups dried tart cherries
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
Pinch of Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 cups blanched and lightly toasted almonds
2 cups coarsely chopped bittersweet chocolate
1 cup hazelnuts
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 cup all-purpose f lour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
2 cups dried apricots
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
Decorative coarse sugar, for sprinkling
1 large egg, beaten, for the egg wash

Combine the butter and flour in the bowl of a food processor and process until the chunks of butter are broken up and the mixture has taken on the consistency of wet sand, about 30 seconds.
Transfer the butter-flour mixture to a large mixing bowl and add the salt, cream cheese, and sour cream. Mix the ingredients together vigorously with your hands, breaking up the cream cheese and working it into the f lour with your fingers until the mixture is crumbly and only pea-size chunks of the cream cheese remain.
Turn out the dough onto a sheet of aluminum foil, press it down slightly into a thick disk, and wrap it very tightly in the foil. Refrigerate it for at least 20 minutes or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling.
Combine the cherries, sugar, water, and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce the heat and simmer until syrupy, about 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and add the almond extract. Let the mixture rest until it's cool enough to handle. Place the almonds in the bowl of a food processor and process until crushed, about 10 seconds. Transfer the almonds to a bowl and add the reserved cherry mixture to the food processor; process until the mixture has a jam-like consistency, scraping down the sides of the machine as necessary. Add the almonds back in and process for a few seconds, until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The filling can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months.
Combine all the filling ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and process until crumbly. The filling can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months.
Combine all the filling ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring them to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Set the mixture aside until it is just cool enough to handle, then transfer it to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Refrigerate the filling until it's completely cooled before using. The filling can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 10-by-15-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, grease it with oil or cooking spray, and sprinkle it with a small handful of decorative sugar.
Unwrap the dough and divide it into 2 equal-size portions. On a well-floured surface, press and work one of the dough portions into a ball, then press the ball into a disk that's about 3/4 inch thick. The dough will be very firm at first and may crack around the edges, so keep working it and bringing the cracks together until you have a smooth-sided disk, adding more flour as needed to keep your hands from sticking to the dough.
Roll out the dough into a 10- to 12-inch circle of even thickness. Fold the circle into a half moon and use a knife or dough cutter to trim away any uneven or protruding edges, then unfold the dough so it's a circle again.
If you're using the chocolate-hazelnut filling, brush a little of the egg wash over the dough. Use a spatula to spread a heaping cup of the filling of your choice evenly over the dough. Then use a dough cutter or pizza cutter to cut the circle into 16 equal-size wedges, just as you would a pizza.
Then, working with one wedge at a time, roll a wedge up to make the rugelach, starting with the wide end and rolling toward the pointy end. Transfer the rugelach to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
Brush the tops of the rugelach with the egg wash, sprinkle lightly with more decorative sugar, and bake, rotating the tray 180 degrees halfway through cooking, until the pastries are light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.

Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies, aka  inchThe Nora Ephron inch
electric Mixer, 1-ounce ice Cream scoop (optional but recommended for the most uniform cookie sandwiches)
1 1/2 cups (14 ounces/400 grams) creamy peanut butter, such as Skippy
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick/3 ounces/168 grams) unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups (8 ounces/227 grams) all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 2/3 cups (5 1/4 ounces/99 grams) rolled oats, such as Quaker old fashioned
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons/11 1/4 ounces/320 grams) unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup (3 1/2 ounces/125 grams) crunchy natural peanut butter, such as Adams, well mixed
3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces/150 grams) granulated sugar
2/3 cup (5 1/4 ounces/150 grams) packed brown sugar
2 large eggs at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1. To make the peanut butter filling, combine all the filling ingredients in a bowl using a whisk. Cover and chill the mixture until you are ready to fill the cookies.
2. To make the peanut butter cookies, in a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Stir in the oats and salt. Set the dry ingredients aside.
3. In the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, chunky peanut butter, and sugars and cream on medium-high speed until very fluffy and pale, at least 3 minutes, scraping down the mixing bowl as needed.
4. Turn the mixer to medium-low and add the eggs, one at a time, beating to incorporate each egg and scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the dry ingredients on low speed in 3 to 4 additions and mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Remove the bowl from the mixer and scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula, going all the way to the bottom of the bowl to mix in the dry ingredients well.
5. Use an ice cream scoop to portion all the cookies in 1-ounce scoops (or use about 1 heaping tablespoon per cookie), placing the scoops on a parchment lined baking sheet. You should have about 48 cookies. (You can place all the cookies close together for the chilling stepâyou will space them for baking later.) Chill the scooped cookies for at least 2 hours or longer.
6. When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange 8 cookies, spaced evenly apart and staggered, on each parchment-lined baking sheet. (Note: Do not flatten the cookies; they will flatten as they bake.) Set the baking sheet inside another baking sheet to double pan and place it in the oven. Bake until evenly golden, about 12 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the cooking time. If you have 2 double-panned pans in the oven at the same time, also switch them between the racks. Remove the pan from the oven and cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes before removing the cookies with a metal spatula. Allow the cookies to cool completely before filling them.
7. To make a cookie sandwich, turn one cookie flat side up and spread with a little less than 2 teaspoons of filling. (If you have a 1-ounce scoop, you can slightly underfill it to portion the filling or underfill a tablespoon.) Top with another cookie, flat side down, pressing gently. Repeat until all the cookies are assembled into sandwiches.

Spiced Bundt Cake with Apple Caramel Sauce
1 cup sugar
Pinch of cream of tartar
1/4 cup fresh apple cider
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups slivered almonds
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup powdered sugar plus more
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
3 large eggs
5 large egg yolks
1 cup whole milk
A 10 inch-diameter nonstick Bundt pan

Combine sugar, cream of tartar, and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook, without stirring and occasionally swirling pan for even cooking, until mixture turns a dark amber color. Remove from heat; slowly add apple cider, cream, vinegar, vanilla, and salt (mixture will bubble vigorously), whisking to combine. Return pan to medium heat and bring to a vigorous boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring to dissolve any caramel bits, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool. Set aside. DO AHEAD: Caramel sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm slightly before using.
Arrange a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Generously coat Bundt pan with nonstick spray. Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Cook, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns (do not burn), about 5 minutes. Carefully remove vanilla bean; pour brown butter into a medium bowl and chill until slightly firm, about 45 minutes.
Pulse flour and almonds in a food processor until almonds are finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in baking powder and next 7 ingredients; set aside.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat brown butter, brown sugar, sugar, and 3/4 cup powdered sugar in a large bowl, frequently scraping down sides and bottom of bowl and beaters, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Mix in lemon zest. Add eggs and yolks one at a time, beating to blend between additions; beat mixture until fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Reduce speed to low. Add half of dry ingredients; mix until almost blended. Add milk and mix until almost blended. Add remaining dry ingredients; mix until batter is blended and smooth. Scrape into prepared pan. Tap pan gently on counter to even out.
Bake until a tester inserted near the center of cake comes out clean and cake is dark golden brown and has begun pulling from sides of pan, 65-70 minutes.
Transfer pan to a wire rack. Let cake cool in pan for 25 minutes. Invert cake onto rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Cake can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
Dust cake lightly with powdered sugar. Drizzle caramel sauce over cake, allowing it to drip down sides and into grooves and crevices. Serve remaining sauce alongside.

Puerto Rican Pineapple Rum Cake
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 1/2 cups dark rum
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 pineapple, cored and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
2 cups sugar
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon dark rum
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup crushed pecans
Vanilla ice cream for serving
1 (9-inch) square cake pan

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
In a small saucepan over moderate heat, combine the brown sugar and 1 cup rum, and bring to a simmer. Continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until reduced by about 1/3. Whisk in the butter. Add the pineapple slices, gently stirring to coat them in the glaze, then let them sit for about 3 minutes. Transfer the pineapple slices to the bottom of a 9-inch square cake pan, arranging them to cover the bottom.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat on medium until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and rum, and beat for 30 seconds. Fold in the flour and salt. Scrape the batter (it will be thick) over the pineapples in the pan. Sprinkle the pecans over the batter and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let the cake cool on a rack for 15 minutes then flip it onto a serving plate so that the pineapples are on top. DO AHEAD: The cake be baked in advance, covered, and kept at room temperature up to 10 hours.
In a small saucepan over moderate heat, combine the rum glaze and the remaining 1/2 cup rum and warm until heated through. Cut the cake into squares and serve with vanilla ice cream and warm rum glaze.

Rugelach
4 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into 4 pieces
1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup seedless raspberry jam, apricot jam or marmalade
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped nuts (I prefer pecans, but you can use walnuts or almonds)
1/4 cup plump, moist dried currants
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped, or 2/3 cup store-bought mini chocolate chips
1 large egg
1 teaspoon cold water
2 tablespoons sugar, preferably decorating (coarse) sugar

Let the cream cheese and butter rest on the counter for 10 minutes-you want them to be slightly softened but still cool.
Put the flour and salt in a food processor, scatter over the chunks of cream cheese and butter and pulse the machine 6 to 10 times. Then process, scraping down the sides of the bowl often, just until the dough forms large curds-don't work it so long that it forms a ball on the blade.
Turn the dough out, gather it into a ball and divide it in half. Shape each half into a disk, wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 1 day. (Wrapped airtight, the dough can be frozen for up to 1 month.)
Heat the jam in a saucepan over low heat, or do this in a microwave oven, until it liquefies. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together.
Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. (Silicone baking mats are great for rugelach.)
Pull one packet of dough from the refrigerator. If it is too firm to roll easily, either leave it on the counter for about 10 minutes or give it a few bashes with your rolling pin.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 11- to 12-inch circle. Spoon (or brush) a thin gloss of jam over the dough, and sprinkle over half of the cinnamon sugar. Scatter over half of the nuts, half of the currants and half of the chopped chocolate. Cover the filling with a piece of wax paper and gently press the filling into the dough, then remove the paper and save it for the next batch.
Using a pizza wheel or a sharp knife, cut the dough into 16 wedges, or triangles. (The easiest way to do this is to cut the dough into quarters, then to cut each quarter into 4 triangles.) Starting at the base of each triangle, roll the dough up so that each cookie becomes a little crescent. Arrange the roll-ups on one baking sheet, making sure the points are tucked under the cookies, and refrigerate. Repeat with the second packet of dough, and refrigerate the cookies for at least 30 minutes before baking. (The cookies can be covered and refrigerated overnight or frozen for up to 2 months; don't defrost before baking, just add a couple of extra minutes to the baking time.)
Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Stir the egg and water together, and brush a bit of this glaze over each rugelach. Sprinkle the cookies with the sugar.
Bake the cookies for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and front to back at the midway point, until they are puffed and golden. Transfer the cookies to racks to cool to just warm or to room temperature.

English Eccles Cake
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup dried currants
2 tablespoons candied mixed fruit peel, chopped
1/2 cup white sugar, plus extra for decoration
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 (17.5-ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1/4 cup whole milk
1 large egg, beaten

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Thoroughly grease a large baking sheet.
2. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in currants, fruit peel, white sugar, brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and fruit is coated. Remove from heat.
3. Roll out thawed pastry on a clean, lightly-floured surface until it is 1/4-inch thick. Cut out eight circles, each roughly 5 inches in diameter; set aside remaining pastry dough for use in other recipes. Divide currant mixture evenly between circles, then moisten edges of pastries with a little bit of milk, fold together, and pinch to seal.
4. Turn pastries upside down onto floured surface and carefully roll out to make a wider and flatter pastry. Be careful not to break the dough.
5. Brush cakes with beaten egg, then sprinkle with white sugar. Make three parallel cuts across the top of each cake, then place on greased baking sheet.
6. Bake pastries in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and sprinkle with a little more sugar, then serve.

Quick Double-Chocolate Sheet Cake
3/4 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup superfine sugar
4 large eggs
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa, dissolved in 3 to 4 tablespoons boiling water to make a smooth paste
1 2/3 cups less 1 tablespoon self-rising flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate chips chocolate buttons, smarties, or fresh raspberries, to decorate
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa, dissolved in 2 tablespoons boiling water to make a paste
5 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line a 11 x 7 x 2-inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, place the softened butter, sugar, eggs, and dissolved cocoa. Sift over the flour and baking powder. Using a hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Using a metal spoon, fold in the chocolate chips.
Turn the mixture into the greased pan and spread it out evenly. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until risen and springy to the touch. Cool slightly before turning out onto a wire rack.
Once the cake is cool, in a bowl, place all the frosting ingredients and, using the hand mixer, beat together well. Spread over the cake. Run a fork across the surface of the frosting to create a wavy pattern of lines.

Amaretto Olive Oil Cake
1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) blanched slivered almonds
1/4 cup matzoh cake meal (see Cooks' notes)
1/4 cup potato starch (see Cooks' notes)
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt plus more for beating whites
5 large egg yolks
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil plus more for pan
3 tablespoons Amaretto liqueur
4 large egg whites at room temperature
Fresh raspberries for serving
A 9-inch round cake pan (2 inches deep) or 9-inch springform pan; parchment paper

Heat oven to 325 degrees F with rack in middle. Grease pan with some oil, then line bottom with a round of parchment.
Toast almonds in a rimmed baking sheet until fragrantly toasty and a shade darker, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely.
Combine toasted almonds, matzoh meal, potato starch, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in a food processor. Pulse until almonds are very finely ground.
Whisk together egg yolks, olive oil, Amaretto, and half of almond mixture in a large bowl until combined (mixture will be slightly grainy from almonds).
Beat whites with a pinch of salt in another bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Increase speed to medium high and add 1/2 cup sugar in a slow steady stream, beating, and continue to beat meringue until it holds stiff glossy peaks.
Fold one third of meringue into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining meringue gently but thoroughly.
Sprinkle remaining almond mixture evenly over the batter and fold in gently but thoroughly. Pour batter into prepared pan, and smooth the top. Sprinkle the top evenly with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.
Bake until cake is golden, the top has formed a crust, and a tester comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and run a sharp knife along edge of pan. Cool cake in pan 30 minutes.
If using a springform pan, remove sides of springform. Then, whether you are using the springform or a round cake pan, invert cake onto the rack. Remove bottom (if using springform) and parchment. Set another cooling rack over bottom of cake, then reinvert cake onto second rack, and cool completely.
Serve cake in wedges with berries on the side.

Thai Iced Tea Cake
1 stick unsalted butter
1/2 cup loose-leaf Thai tea (cha-yen)
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 (6-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, divided in half
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup powdered sugar

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Use butter wrapper to grease an 8-inch loaf pan, 8-inch square cake pan, or 8-inch round cake pan.
2. Brew tea with 3/4 cup boiling water, covered, for 10 minutes. Strain tea leaves and discard. In a mixing bowl, combine butter and freshly brewed tea until butter is completely melted. Whisk vanilla, half of the sweetened condensed milk, and the eggs. Mixture should be bright orange and very creamy. Gently stir in salt, flour, and baking powder. Pour into prepared pan and bake for 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow cake to cool for 20 minutes.
3. While cake cools, make the glaze. Whisk together remaining sweetened condensed milk and powdered sugar until a thick, creamy mixture forms.
4. To serve cake, run a knife along the edge of the cooled cake to gently loosen it from its pan. Turn cake out onto a plate and drizzle glaze over the top, allowing it to run down the sides of the cake.
5. Cake can either be served immediately or chilled and served cold.

Lemon Buttermilk Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing, at room temperature
1 3/4 cups sugar
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1 tablespoon lemon zest
5 tablespoons lemon juice
4 large eggs, at room temperature
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more as needed

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease and flour a (9-inch) Bundt pan or line 36 muffin tins with paper liners.
2. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and light in texture, about 5 minutes. While the butter is beating, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt, and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk, lemon zest, and 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice and set aside.
3. Add the eggs to the butter-sugar mixture, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. In 3 additions, alternate adding the sifted dry ingredients and the wet ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture, stirring on low until just incorporated.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan or fill each muffin cup two-thirds full with batter. Bake until the center of cake springs back when touched and a skewer inserted near the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Bake cupcakes until they rise in a dome shape and spring back when lightly pressed with a fingertip, 16 to 20 minutes.
5. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Release the sides and bottom of the cake from the pan with a narrow metal spatula or knife. Invert the pan and turn out the cake. Place a wire rack in a baking pan and set the cake, right side up, on the rack.
6. In a small bowl, combine the confectioner's sugar, the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon cold water and stir until very smooth. Add a little more confectioners' sugar or water as necessary to achieve a glaze consistency (similar to that of honey). Spoon the glaze evenly over the cake. When the glaze has firmed, transfer the cake to a plate. Slice and serve at room temperature.

2 3/4 cups powdered sugar
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
Three 9 inch-diameter cake pans with 2 inch sides

Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pans with parchment-paper rounds; coat paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until no lumps remain. Combine buttermilk, oil, and vanilla in a medium bowl.
Combine sugar, butter, and brown sugar in another large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Using an electric mixer, beat butter mixture until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add yolks and eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl.
Continue to beat mixture, occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl, until almost doubled in volume and very light, airy, and pale yellow, 5-6 minutes. It's very important that no lumps remain at this stage. (Occasional scraping of the bowl, especially the bottom, helps prevent lumps.)
With mixer on low, add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
Divide batter evenly among prepared pans, about 3 1/2 cups per pan. Smooth tops.
Bake, rotating cakes from left to right and top to bottom halfway through, until cakes are light golden brown, the centers spring back when gently pressed, and a tester inserted into the centers comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 35-40 minutes.
Transfer cakes to wire racks; let cool in pans for at least 30 minutes. Invert cakes onto racks, peel off parchment, and let cool completely.
Using a long serrated knife, remove top dome and any bumps from each cake to create a flat surface. Slice each cake in half horizontally to make 6 layers total. DO AHEAD: Cakes can be baked 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.
Stir chocolate and corn syrup in a large metal bowl set over a large saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth; remove from heat. Stir sour cream, salt, and vanilla in a medium metal bowl; set over same saucepan of simmering water. Stir until mixture is warm but not hot, about 2 minutes. Add sour cream mixture to chocolate mixture; stir until smooth and glossy. Set aside.
Using an electric mixer, beat powdered sugar and butter in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Slowly beat in chocolate mixture. Continue beating until no lumps remain, about 2 minutes. Frosting should be smooth and shiny. Cover and chill until slightly firmed up, about 30 minutes.
Place 1 cake layer on a cake stand or large plate. Spoon 1/3 cup frosting over; using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, smooth frosting to edge of cake, creating an even layer. Place another cake layer on top. Repeat with frosting and remaining cake layers. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. DO AHEAD: Cake can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with a cake dome and store at room temperature.

The Tomboy Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more
1 cup slivered almonds
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 cup whole milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups sugar, divided
4 large egg yolks
6 large egg whites
1/4 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup sugar
2 large eggs
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 cup chilled heavy cream
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
3 large egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup strawberry jam
Three 8 inch-diameter cake pans with 2 inch sides; a candy thermometer; a pastry bag; a large star piping tip

Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour cake pans. Line bottom of pans with parchmentâpaper rounds; butter paper. Pulse 2 1/2 cups flour and almonds in a food processor until almonds are finely ground. Transfer to a medium bowl and whisk in baking powder and salt; set aside.
Combine milk and vanilla in a measuring cup; set aside. Using an electric mixer, beat 2 cups sugar and 1 cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3â4 minutes. Add egg yolks and continue to beat, occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl, until pale yellow and fluffy, 4â5 minutes. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with milk mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. (Do not overmix or cake will dome and be dense.)
Using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters, whip egg whites in a medium bowl until light and frothy. With mixer running, gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Beat meringue until medium peaks form, 3â4 minutes.
Fold 1/4 of meringue into batter just until incorporated (this will lighten batter, making it easier to fold in remaining meringue). Gently fold in remaining meringue until fully incorporated. Divide batter evenly among prepared pans. Smooth tops.
Bake cakes, rotating from left to right and top to bottom halfway through, until golden brown and the sides of cakes begin to pull away from pans, 40â45 minutes. Transfer to wire racks. Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto racks; peel off parchment and let cool completely.
If needed, use a long serrated knife to trim dome from each cake (about 1/8 inch) to create a flat surface. DO AHEAD: Cakes can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.
Place 2 teaspoons cold water in a small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes.
Whisk lemon juice, sugar, and eggs in a medium metal bowl; place over a large saucepan of simmering water and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens, 5â6 minutes. (Do not allow bottom of bowl to touch the water or mixture will cook too fast and eggs may scramble.)
Remove bowl from heat and transfer mixture to a blender. With blender running, add butter 1 piece at a time until butter is completely incorporated. Add softened gelatin and blend 30 seconds longer.
Transfer lemon curd to a medium bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd. Chill until cold and set, 3â4 hours or overnight.
Using an electric mixer, beat chilled cream in another medium bowl until soft peaks form (warm cream will not whip up). Add powdered sugar. Continue to beat until medium peaks form, 2â3 minutes. Whisk curd to loosen; gently fold in whipped cream; set aside. DO AHEAD: Lemon cream can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
Bring 3/4 cup sugar, salt, and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook without stirring until candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 4â5 minutes.
Meanwhile, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites in a medium bowl until light and frothy (be sure to keep a close eye on the sugar syrup). Beat in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and cream of tartar.
With mixer running, gradually add hot syrup in a thin stream, allowing syrup to drizzle down side of bowl into egg whites. Beat until egg whites are tripled in volume and meringue is very fluffy, cool, and opaque white, about 12 minutes with a stand mixer and up to 20 minutes with a hand mixer. (Frosting made with a hand mixer may not be as firm as that made with a stand mixer.) Add vanilla and mix 1 minute longer. Use meringue immediately.
Fill a pastry bag fitted with large star tip halfway with prepared meringue.
Place 1 cake layer on a cake stand or platter. Spread 1/3 cup strawberry jam over, leaving a 1 inch border around edge. Spread 1/3 cup lemon cream over jam, keeping 1 inch border. Pipe a ring of meringue frosting over 1 inch border around edge. Place second cake layer atop meringue, pressing slightly to adhere. Repeat process with second cake layer, jam, lemon cream, and meringue. (Cover and chill remaining lemon cream for another use.) Place remaining layer on top. Using offset spatula, generously spread remaining meringue frosting on top layer of cake. Chill up to 4 hours.

Jam Cake with Caramel Chocolate Ganache
Three 8-inch round cake pans, greased and bottoms lined with parchment paper circles
2 3/4 cups (13 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 1/2 cups (17 1/4 ounces) jam, preferably blackberry, raspberry, or apricot
3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
3/4 cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups (10 1/2 ounces) sugar
4 eggs, at room temperature
1 cup (4 ounces) sliced natural almonds, toasted
Caramel Chocolate Ganache

Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt, then whisk the mixture to ensure that the ingredients are well distributed.
In a small bowl, stir together the jam and the buttermilk.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Blend in the eggs one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the buttermilk mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop and scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete the blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.
Divide the batter evenly into the prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 4 ounces per pan) and smooth the tops. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers are just barely firm when lightly touched, 32 to 34 minutes. Cool the cakes on a wire rack for 30 minutes before removing them from their pans. Once removed, continue to cool the cakes on the rack, top side up, until they reach room temperature. Leave the parchment paper on until you assemble the cake.
To assemble the cake, place one of the layers, top side up, on a flat plate or a cake board. Using a thin metal spatula, spread a thin layer of caramel ganache (a bit more than 1/2 cup) on top of the cake and out to the edges of the cake. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of almonds evenly over the ganache. Align the next cake layer, top side up, on top of the first one, and repeat with another thin layer of ganache and almonds. Place the final layer of cake on top of the cake. Frost the top heavily and the sides lightly with the remainder of the ganache. Lightly press the remaining toasted almonds on the sides of cake.
This cake is best stored and served at room temperature. In an airtight container, it keeps for up to 5 days.

Pour batter into prepared pan; smooth top. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup pistachios over.
Bake cake, rotating halfway through, until a tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely in pan. Run a sharp knife around sides to loosen; unmold cake. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Arya's Snitched Tarts
1 bottle inexpensive sweet red wine, such as a Shiraz
1 1/2 cups honey
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Poudre Forte
1/2 cup chopped dates or prunes
1/2 cup currants
1 cup fresh or dried figs, if available (if not, substitute your favorite berries), diced
Crumbled candied nuts (optional, but delicious)
1 batch Medieval Sweet Dough
Vegetable oil for frying

Bring the wine and honey to a boil, then reduce the heat and skim off the foam until the liquid is clear. Add the vinegar, poudre forte, and fruits; return the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Keep an eye on the fruit as you proceedâdo not overreduce it! The syrup should lightly coat the back of a spoon and reduce by about a third to a half.
Roll the sweet dough to about 1/4-inch thickness on a floured board, then use a circular cutter or drinking glass to cut out circles about 2 inches in diameter.
Pour a shallow layer of oil into a skillet or pan and place it over medium-high heat until hot. Working a few at a time, gently slip dough circles into the oil and fry until they are lightly browned and very crisp. Transfer the fried circles to paper towels to drain. Arrange the cakes on a serving platter, then spoon on just enough of the fruit mixture to cover each disk. Sprinkle with candied nuts. The yellowish cakes and the red topping make an interesting contrast in colors, and the wine will soften the cakes.

1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
12 ounces (3 cups) fresh raspberries
1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon water
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 1/2 quarts vanilla ice cream
1 1/2 cups chilled heavy cream
1/3 cup confectioners sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup mixed fresh blueberries and raspberries
A 9-inch springform pan; a small offset metal spatula

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Invert bottom of springform pan (to make it easier to slide cake off bottom) and lock on side. Butter pan and line bottom with a round of parchment or wax paper. Butter paper, then dust paper with additional flour, knocking out excess.
Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.
In a separate bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer (fitted with paddle attachment if using a stand mixer) at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add in warmed eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in vanilla.
Reduce speed to low, then add flour mixture in 3 batches alternately with sour cream, beginning and ending with flour and mixing until batter is smooth. Spoon batter into springform pan, spreading evenly.
Bake cake until it begins to pull away from side of pan and a wooden toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then carefully run a thin knife around edge of cake and remove side of pan. Invert cake onto rack, then remove bottom of pan and carefully peel off paper. Let cake cool completely.
Combine all ingredients except water and cornstarch in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and briskly simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir water into cornstarch in a small bowl, then stir into blueberry filling and gently boil, stirring, 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and chill, uncovered, until cold.
Combine all ingredients except water and cornstarch in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and briskly simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir water into cornstarch in a small bowl, then stir into raspberry filling and gently boil, stirring, 1 minute. Force filling through a large fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, scraping bottom of sieve to release pulp into bowl. Discard solids in sieve. Chill filling, uncovered, until cold.
Cut cooled cake horizontally into 3 even layers with a long serrated knife (see Cooks' Notes for an easy method). Line 9-inch springform pan with 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap, letting excess hang over edge. Put bottom layer, cut side up, in pan. Spread cold blueberry filling over cake using offset spatula, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edge, then freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
Slightly soften ice cream in microwave, then scoop half of it, preferably in thin curls that you can lay over blueberry layer, and gently spread it evenly to edge of cake. Return remaining ice cream to freezer. Put middle cake layer on top of ice cream, gently pressing it down, and spread cold raspberry filling over cake, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edge. Freeze cake until raspberry layer is firm, about 30 minutes.
Slightly soften remaining ice cream, if necessary, and spread in same manner evenly over raspberry filling to edge of cake. Put remaining cake layer on top of ice cream, cut side down, and gently press it down, then freeze cake, well wrapped in plastic, until very firm, 4 to 6 hours.
Beat heavy cream with confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a large deep bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks.
Remove side and bottom of springform pan and peel plastic from cake. Set cake on a serving plate that will fit in the freezer. Spread some of whipped cream in a thin layer around side and top of cake and freeze cake until cream is firm, about 30 minutes (meanwhile, keep remaining whipped cream cold in refrigerator).
Frost cake with remaining cream, leaving swirls in cream on top to help hold berries. Freeze until very firm, at least 30 minutes.
To serve, transfer cake to refrigerator to soften, 30 minutes to 1 hour, and garnish with berries.

Yellow Butter Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing, at room temperature
2 cups sugar
3 1/2 cups cake flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs, plus 2 large egg whites, at room temperature
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 cup whole or low-fat milk

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease and flour 2 (8-inch) cake pans.
2. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and light in texture, about 4 minutes. While the butter is beating, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.
3. Add the eggs and egg whites to the butter-sugar mixture, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the vanilla with the milk.

The Pink Cake
Three 8 by 2-inch round cake pans, greased and bottoms lined with greased parchment paper circles
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup (1 ounce) lightly packed premium unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa
3/4 cup boiling water
3/4 cup (6 3/4 ounces) full-fat sour cream
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup (7 1/2 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar
3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
3 egg yolks, at room temperature
3 eggs, at room temperature
Raspberry Buttercream

Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the unsweetened chocolate and the cocoa into a small bowl. Pour the boiling water over the chocolate and allow it to steep for 1 minute. Whisk the mixture together. Whisk in the sour cream and vanilla. Set aside.
Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, then whisk the mixture by hand to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and both sugars together on medium-high speed until light, about 3 minutes. As you make the batter, stop the mixer frequently and scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. On low speed, drizzle the oil into the mixture until blended. Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until the batter is fluffy, about 3 more minutes. Blend in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, adding the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared into the batter. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the chocolate mixture in two parts, beginning and ending with the flour. After each addition, mix until just barely blended and stop and scrape the bowl. Stop the mixer before the last of the flour has been incorporated and complete the blending by hand with a rubber spatula to ensure you do not overbeat the batter.
Divide the thick batter equally among the prepared pans (there will be approximately 1 pound 2 ounces per pan). Smooth the tops and tap the pans on the counter to settle the batter and eliminate any large air bubbles. Bake in the middle of the oven until the centers spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Flip the cakes out of the pans, leaving on the parchment paper until you assemble the cake. Let them continue to cool on the rack, top sides up, until they reach room temperature.
To assemble the cake, lay one of the cakes top side up on a cake plate. Using a metal spatula, frost the top with 3/4 cup of buttercream, spreading it out to the edge of the cake (the filling will be about 1/4 inch thick). Stack the second cake top side up on top of the frosted cake and spread another 3/4 cup of buttercream on top of it. Stack the last layer of cake top side up on top. Look for any frosting that may have oozed out beween the layers and spread it along the sides of the cake. Apply a thin layer of frosting all over the cake to create a  inchcrumb coat. inch Place the cake in the refrigerator until the frosting is firm, about 10 minutes. Take it out and frost the cake with the remaining buttercream, using your spatula to make decorative swirls.
Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Caramel Cheesecake Bites
Buttery Sugar Cookie dough recipe
20 ounces jarred or canned dulce de leche at room temperature (see Cooks' Notes)
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2/3 cup sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
A 13- by 9-inch baking pan; small offset metal spatula (optional but so helpful); disposable pastry bag (optional)

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Line a 13- by 9-inch inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving an overhang at both ends, and lightly butter.
Make Buttery Sugar Cookie dough as directed, but press dough evenly into bottom of pan. Use the flat bottom of a metal cup measure or a glass to compact and press the dough into as even a layer as possible.
Bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes, then cool completely in pan on a rack, and keep oven on.
Stir dulce de leche well, then spread 1 1/4 cups of itâthere will be some left overâevenly over cookie base with offset spatula and quick-chill in freezer or chill in refrigerator until cold.
Slowly beat cream cheese and sugar on medium speed with an electric mixer (fitted with paddle attachment if using a stand mixer) until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well on medium-low speed after each addition, then mix in vanilla.
Spoon cream cheese mixture over dulce de leche. Bake until cheesecake is puffed and edges are golden, 40 to 45 minutes.
Cool completely in pan on a rack, then chill until cold, about 3 hours.
With aid of foil overhang, lift cheesecake confection from pan.
Dip a long sharp knife in a tall glass of hot water and quickly wipe it off, then trim edges of confection (save scraps for snacking). Continuing to dip knife in hot water and wiping it off before every cut, cut cheesecake lengthwise into 8 strips, then crosswise into 4 sections, to form 32 finger-shaped bites.
Just before serving, if desired, arrange bites on a large rack set over a large rimmed baking sheet, spacing them apart. Put about 2/3 cup dulce de leche in disposable pastry bag, then snip off a tiny opening. Drizzle the dulce de leche in a diagonal pattern over the bites, letting it drape down the sides.

Carrot Cake
1 pound carrots (6 or 7 large carrots), peeled

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
While oven heats, work with 1 piece of dough (keep remaining dough chilled). Roll 1 level tablespoon of dough into a ball, then roll in coarse sugar in a shallow bowl to coat completely. (If dough becomes too soft to roll easily into balls, quick-chill in the freezer or chill in the refrigerator.)
Place balls 2 inches apart on a lined baking sheet. With the flat bottom of a glass, flatten balls into 2-inch rounds.
Bake cookies, one sheet at time, until bottoms are golden, 12 to 15 minutes total. Cool on sheets 2 minutes, then transfer with a metal spatula to racks to cool completely. Make more cookies with remaining dough on cooled baking sheets.

1 teaspoon fresh Key lime or lime juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 (9- by 2-inch) round cake pans; a powerful handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. with rack in middle. Butter cake pans, then line bottoms with rounds of parchment. Dust pans with additional flour, knocking out excess.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl.
Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer (or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment) at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in zest and vanilla and continue beating until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes more. At low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches alternately with milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and mixing until batter is just smooth.
Divide batter between cake pans, spreading it evenly. Bake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean and cakes begin to pull away from sides of pans, 20 to 25 minutes.
Cool for 15 minutes in pans on racks. Run a thin knife around sides of pans, invert cake layers onto racks, and cool completely.
Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a heavy 2-quart saucepan, then whisk in 3/4 cup water and juice until smooth. Whisk together eggs in a medium heat-proof bowl until well combined.
Bring juice mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring with whisk, then reduce heat and continue to cook at a slow boil, stirring with whisk, 1 minute (mixture will be thick). Remove pan from heat.
Add half of hot juice mixture to eggs in a slow stream, stirring with whisk. Stir egg mixture into juice in pan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, just until it reaches a simmer. Remove pan from heat and add butter and zest, stirring until butter is melted.
Cover filling with a buttered round of wax paper or parchment paper and chill until cold, about 1 hour.

Remove the cupcakes from the pan and place on a cooling rack. Cool completely before filling and frosting.
To prepare the filling, blend the tofu in a food processor until very smooth and creamy, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Add the agave nectar and blend again. Add the peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt and blend thoroughly until very light and smooth. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours to firm before filling the cupcakes.
To assemble the cupcakes, you will need a pastry bag fitted with a large, plain smooth tip. Fill the pastry bag with peanut butter mousse and insert the tip halfway into the top of a cupcake. Squeeze filling inside each cupcake just until it starts to expand.
Next frost the tops. If the frosting is too firm, heat in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up. Spread the ganache evenly over the tops of the cupcakes. Let the cupcakes sit in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Garnish with peanuts if desired.

Lemony Slice-and-Bakes
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 large egg yolks
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons (or more) fresh lemon juice
Food coloring (optional)
Sanding sugar (optional)

Whisk flour and salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla in a large bowl, occasionally scraping down sides, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks; beat just to blend. Reduce speed to low; add flour mixture and beat, occasionally scraping down sides, just to blend. Divide dough in half; roll each half into a 10 inch-long log about 1 3/4 inch in diameter. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Arrange racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap 1 dough log. Using a sharp, lightly floured knife, cut log into 1/4 inch-thick rounds. Transfer to prepared sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.
Bake until cookies are firm and golden brown around edges, 16-18 minutes. Let cool for 1 minute, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough log, using cooled baking sheets and new parchment paper.
Whisk sugar and 2 tablespoons juice in a small bowl, adding more juice by 1/2-teaspoonfuls if too thick. Add coloring, if desired. Spread or drizzle icing over cookies. Decorate as desired. Let stand until icing sets, about 10 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Apple Brown Betty with Sorghum Zabaglione
6 to 8 apples (Gala or Granny Smith), peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
Juice of 1 lemon
1/2 vanilla bean, seeds and pod
1/2 loaf bread, crust removed (any type of white bread is fine)
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
3 cups Sorghum Zabaglione

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter an 8 by 8-inch baking dish.
In a large bowl, toss the apples with the granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, lemon juice, and the vanilla pod and seeds. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 30 minutes.
Tear the bread up and pulse in a food processor. Spread out the bread crumbs on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until golden. Set aside.
While the bread crumbs are toasting, place 4 tablespoons of the butter into a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the milk solids separate from the fat and the butter begins to brown.
In a medium bowl, mix the bread crumbs, brown sugar, and warm brown butter together. Add about one-quarter of the bread-crumb mixture to the apples. Toss to combine.
Fill the prepared baking dish with the apple mixture. Dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.
Cover the top with the remaining bread-crumb mixture. Press down firmly all over the top so that the mixture is tightly packed in the dish.
Bake on the middle rack of the oven until the apples are soft and the juices start to bubble, 25 to 35 minutes.
Serve warm and with a 1/2-cup scoop of sorghum zabaglione on top of each portion.

Cardamom Crescents
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, divided
1 cup pecans
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Arrange racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl. Combine 1/2 cup sugar and pecans in a food processor; pulse until coarse meal forms. Using an electric mixer, beat butter and vanilla in a medium bowl until creamy, 2-3 minutes. Add nut mixture; beat to blend. Add dry ingredients; blend well (dough will be moist but still crumbly). Transfer to a work surface; knead to form a ball, about 4 turns.
Measure 1 rounded tablespoon of dough; form into a ball, then roll into a 1 1/2 inch-long log. Gently bend into a crescent shape, pinching ends to taper (cookies may crack slightly). Repeat with remaining dough, spacing about 1 inch apart on prepared sheets.
Bake, rotating sheets halfway through baking, until bottoms are golden, 12-15 minutes. Sift remaining 1 cup powdered sugar into a shallow wide bowl. Working in batches of about 8 cookies each, roll warm cookies gently in powdered sugar to coat. Transfer to a wire rack to let cool. Roll or dust cooled cookies with powdered sugar. DO AHEAD: Can be made 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Chocolate Peppermint Stars
Buttery Sugar Cookie dough recipe with an addition and adjustments
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup coarsely crushed small red and white candy canes (see Cooks' Notes)
4 ounces good bittersweet (60% cacao) chocolate, melted (see Cooks' Notes)
Wax paper; parchment paper; 2 large baking sheets; 2- to 3-inch star cookie cutters; small offset spatula (optional)

Make Buttery Sugar Cookie dough as directed, but reduce the flour to 1 1/3 cups and add the cocoa. Whisk the flour and cocoa together.
Halve dough and wrap each half in wax paper, shaping each into a flattened rectangle, then store each half in a resealable plastic bag. Chill dough until firm, at least 2 hours.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
While oven heats, roll out 1 piece of dough (keep remaining dough chilled) between two large sheets of wax paper to slightly less than 1/4 inch thick. (If dough becomes too soft to roll out, quick-chill on a baking sheet in the freezer or chill in the refrigerator until firm.)
Peel back top sheet of wax paper and cut out as many cookies with cutter as possible. Transfer cookies, as cut, to a lined baking sheet, arranging them 1 inch apart. (If dough becomes too soft to remove the cookies, quick-chill on a baking sheet in the freezer or chill in the refrigerator until firm.)
Gather, reroll, and chill scraps to form more cookies.
Freeze or chill cut-out cookies on baking sheet until firm before baking.
Bake cookies, one sheet at time, until edges are a shade darker and centers are set, 9 to 12 minutes. For picture-perfect cookies, use cookie cutters while cookies are hot from the oven to trim edges. (Keep trimmings for snacks.) Transfer cookies with a metal spatula to racks to cool completely. Make more cookies with remaining dough. (Cool baking sheets and use fresh parchment between batches.)
Using the offset spatula or a small rubber spatula, spread cooled cookies with a thin layer of melted chocolate, then sprinkle with some crushed candy canes.
Let cookies stand at room temperature until the chocolate has set, about 1 hour.

Almond-Cranberry Quinoa Cookies
1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup cooked quinoa, cooled
1 cup old-fashioned oats
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup slivered unsalted almonds
Ingredient info: White whole wheat flour and quinoa can be found at better supermarkets and at natural foods stores.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat butter, both sugars, and honey in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs and extracts; beat until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time. Stir in quinoa, oats, cranberries, and almonds. Spoon dough in 2-tablespoon portions onto prepared sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.
Bake cookies until golden, 12-15 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool. DO AHEAD: Store cooled cookies airtight at room temperature for 1 day, or freeze for up to 1 month.

Peppermint Meringues
3 large egg whites, room temperature
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/8 teaspoon peppermint extract
12 drops red food coloring

Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt on medium-high speed until white and foamy, about 1 minute. With mixer running, gradually add sugar in 3 additions, beating for 2 minutes between each addition. Beat until firm peaks form, about 2 minutes longer. Add powdered sugar and peppermint extract; beat to blend, about 1 minute.
Dot coloring over surface of meringue; do not stir (the coloring will form swirls when piped). Spoon meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch tip. (alternatively, spoon into a plastic freezer bag, then cut 1/2 inch off 1 corner.) Twist top; pipe 1 inch rounds onto prepared sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.
Bake meringues until dry, about 2 1/2 hours. Let cool completely, about 1 hour (meringues will crisp as they cool). DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature between sheets of parchment or waxed paper.

Chocolate-Dipped Spritz Washboards with Pistachios
Buttery Sugar Cookie dough recipe with substitutions and an ingredient elimination
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 teaspoon pure almond extract
7 to 8 ounces good bittersweet (60% cacao) chocolate
1/4 cup finely chopped salted pistachios
A cookie press fitted with a 1 1/2-inch-long straight fluted opening; 2 large baking sheets

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle.
Make Buttery Sugar Cookie dough as directed, with the following exceptions:
Eliminate the egg.
Substitute 1 cup confectioners' sugar for the granulated sugar and substitute 3/4 teaspoon almond extract for the 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Pack the cylinder of the press with some of the dough. Proceed according to the cookie press instructions. Pipe the dough in 3-inch-long strips onto a large ungreased baking sheet, spacing them 1 inch apart. Use a paring knife to cut the dough free from the cookie press.
Freeze or chill the cookies on the baking sheet until firm.
Bake until edges are pale golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on sheets 2 minutes, then transfer cookies with a metal spatula to racks to cool.
Continue to pipe, chill, and bake more spritz washboards in batches with remaining dough (pipe and chill on second sheet while first sheet is baking; cool baking sheets between batches and use fresh parchment paper).
Melt chocolate (see Cooks' Notes) in a deep metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove bowl from the pan. Use a folded towel to tilt the bowl slightly, so that the melted chocolate is deep enough for dipping the cookies.
Put pistachios in a shallow bowl.
Set cooling racks on baking sheets.
Dip cookies, one at a time, in chocolate so that it coats about half the cookie on the diagonal, then scrape off the excess chocolate from the bottom of the cookie against the rim of the bowl.
Sprinkle the chocolate with some pistachios and arrange the cookies on the racks.
Let cookies stand at room temperature until the chocolate has set, about 1 hour.

Root Beer Cake
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, for the pan
1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
One 12-ounce bottle (1 1/4 cups) root beer
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
One 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated on a microplane or on the finest side of a box grater (1 teaspoon)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 large egg
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons ground star anise
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/2 whole nutmeg, grated (or 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg)
Finely grated zest of 2 lemons
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon sassafras bark (or 1/2 teaspoon sassafras extract; see Note))
2 cups powdered sugar
Pinch of ground star anise
Pinch of ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 whole nutmeg, grated (or about 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg)
Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-inch cake pan well with some of the butter.
Cut out a piece of parchment paper so it fits closely into the bottom of the cake pan. Line the bottom of the pan with the parchment, and then grease the parchment with more butter.
Shake 1 tablespoon of the flour into the cake pan, and shake it around so it sticks to the butter. Tap out any excess flour that doesn't stick to the parchment or to the sides of the pan.
Pour the root beer and molasses into a deep medium-sized pot, and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. (You need those high sides because the baking soda will froth up very high, and you don't want it to spill over! So make sure there's some meaningful space between the liquid and the top of the pot.)
Pull the pot off the heat and whisk in all the baking soda, so it froths up. Then put the pot right in the fridge to cool down a little.
While the root beer mix is cooling down, whisk the brown sugar, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, ginger, and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. The mixture will be a little chunky at this point.
Crack the egg into the bowl and whisk well. The egg is what makes everything come together smoothly: you should have a thick paste. Set this aside.
In another mixing bowl, combine rest of the flour with the baking powder, star anise, and cardamom. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and add the salt and pepper. Whisk everything together so it's well combined.
Take the root beer mixture out of the fridge. Pour a third of the flour mixture into a large mixing bowl; pour in one-third of the root beer mixture, then one-third of the sugar paste. Whisk everything together slowly (so it doesn't splash everywhere), and then add another one-third of the flour, another one-third of the root beer, and so forth, until everything is combined in the bowl. (The mix doesn't need to be completely and smoothly combined until the last of the wet and dry mixtures are in the bowl.) You should have a very wet, almost liquid batter.
Pour the batter into the cake pan, put the pan on a cookie sheet (to catch drips and splashes), and put it on the middle oven rack.
Bake the cake for 45 minutes without opening the oven at all (this cake will sink if you shake it up while it's baking). Check it: the cake should be high and dark brown, with a little bit of spring-back when you touch it (but not too muchâit's a very moist cake). If it's not quite ready, rotate the pan and put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes before checking it again. The whole baking process shouldn't take longer than 55 minutes, even in a slow oven.
Whisk the cream and sassafras together in a small pot, and bring it up to a boil over medium-high heat.
As soon as it boils, pull the mixture off the heat, pour it into a glass or ceramic container (something that won't crack from the heat), and put it in the fridge. Let the mixture cool for about 30 minutes while the sassafras steeps into the cream, so you have a nice root beer flavor.
In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, star anise, cardamon, and salt. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and whisk everything together.
Strain the cooled cream through a fine-mesh strainer into a small mixing bowl (so the sassafras pieces don't end up in the glaze).
Gently whisk 1/2 cup of the cream into the powdered sugar mixture, holding back the last 2 tablespoons to see if you need it. If the mixture is dry and not coming together as a glaze, add more cream. Whisk the mixture well, until you have a shiny, thick liquid.
When the cake is ready, pull it out of the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes.
Flip the cake out of the pan onto a serving plate.
Spread the glaze thickly on top of the warm cake with a spoon. The glaze will melt and drip down the sides as you slather it on.
You can serve the cake as soon as it's cooled to room temperatureâbut like all spice cakes, it's even better the day after you make it. Store it covered at room temperature.

Chocolate Macaroons with Orange Ganache
2 cups powdered sugar, divided
1 1/4 cups slivered almonds
3 tablespoons natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons egg whites (from about 3 large eggs), room temperature, whisked to loosen
1/4 cup sugar
3 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate (do not exceed 61% cacao), finely chopped
2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
Gold dust (optional)
Ingredient info: Gold dust is available at specialty foods stores and lusterdust.com.

Arrange racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 3 rimless baking sheets with parchment paper. Pulse 1 cup powdered sugar and almonds in a food processor until nuts are very finely ground (but not to a paste), 60-90 seconds. Add cocoa powder and remaining 1 cup powdered sugar; process to blend well. Sift mixture through a medium-mesh strainer into a large bowl; discard larger almond pieces remaining in strainer (if more than 1 tablespoon remains, pulse nuts again in processor and re-sift).
Using an electric mixer, beat 1/3 cup egg whites in a medium bowl on medium speed until white and frothy, about 1 minute. With mixer on medium-low speed, gradually add sugar by tablespoonfuls. Increase speed to medium-high; beat until firm peaks form.
Stir in remaining 3 tablespoons egg whites. Fold meringue into dry ingredients in 2 additions, mixing well between additions.
Spoon meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4 inch tip. (Alternatively, spoon into a plastic freezer bag, then cut 1/4 inch off a corner of bag.) Twist top of bag and pipe quarter size rounds onto 2 of the 3 prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Let stand until tops appear dry, about 10 minutes.
Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through baking, until puffed and dry, about 16 minutes. Slide cookies on parchment onto a wire rack. Let cool completely. Repeat with remaining batter on third baking sheet.
Place chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat; stir in orange zest, cloves, allspice, and salt. Pour hot cream mixture over chocolate and butter; whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.
Spoon ganache into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4 inch tip. (Alternatively, spoon into a plastic freezer bag, then cut 1/4 inch off a corner of bag.) Twist top of bag and pipe about 1 teaspoon ganache onto flat side of 1 cookie, leaving 1/4 inch-1/8 inch plain border. Top with a second cookie, flat side down. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ganache. Brush tops with gold dust, if desired. Layer in an airtight container between sheets of parchment paper and refrigerate overnight. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let return to room temperature before serving.

Megan's Pecan Pralines
3 cups sugar
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons evaporated milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
2 cups (about 8 ounces) pecans, coarsely chopped
pastry brush; 2 large baking sheets; wax paper; candy thermometer

Line 2 large baking sheets with wax paper.
In a large heavy pot, stir together the sugar and 1 cup evaporated milk. Attach a candy thermometer to the pot and place it over moderately low heat. Cook, stirring occasionallyâuse a pastry brush dipped in cold water to wash down any sugar crystals clinging to the side of the potâuntil the sugar is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to moderate and cook the mixture, undisturbed, until the thermometer registers 238 degrees F (soft-ball stage), 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool, undisturbed, until the thermometer registers 220 degrees F, about 6 minutes.
Using a wooden spoon, stir in the vanilla and butter. Continue stirring until the mixture is creamy and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the pecan pieces. Working quickly, use a wooden spoon to scoop up heaping tablespoons of the praline mixture and a small metal spoon to scrape the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between pralines. If the mixture starts to crystallize and harden, add 1 to 2 tablespoons evaporated milk and place over low heat, stirring, until the mixture softens then continue dropping on prepared baking sheets. Let the pralines harden at room temperature. DO AHEAD: Pralines can be made ahead, wrapped individually in waxed paper, and stored in an airtight container in a cool place, up to 1 week.

Kendra's Vanilla-Cherry Chocolate Chip Cookies
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
1 vanilla bean
1 cup (6 ounces) dried cherries
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1/2 cup (3 ounces) white chocolate chips
1/2 cup (3 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) chopped blanched hazelnuts or walnuts
2 large baking sheets; 2 nonstick baking mats such as Silpats or parchment paper

Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and a second rack in the lower third then preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with nonstick baking mats or parchment paper.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
Using a small knife split the vanilla bean lengthwise then scrape the seeds from the pod into a small bowl and reserve both.
In a small bowl, combine the scraped vanilla bean pod (not the seeds), the dried cherries, and about 1 cup boiling water. Let stand 5 minutes then drain, reserving the cherries and discarding the vanilla bean pod.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar, and brown sugar and beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and the vanilla bean seeds and beat on medium until combined, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture in 3 batches, stirring until just combined. Add the cherries, white and semisweet chocolate chips, and the hazelnuts or walnuts and stir until just incorporated.
Drop the dough by heaping tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies. Bake, switching the cookies between the upper and lower racks about halfway through baking, until light golden brown and just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Continue baking cookies on cooled baking sheets.

Gourmet Live's First-Birthday Cake
3 cups sifted cake flour (not self-rising; sift before measuring)
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 sticks (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened
2 cups sugar
4 large eggs, warmed in warm water 5 minutes
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups well-stirred plain, whole-milk yogurt (not Greek-style), at room temperature (see Cooks' Notes)
3/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup boiling-hot water
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate (60% cacao), chopped fine
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate (100% cacao), chopped fine
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon pieces and softened
3 (8- or 9-inch) round cake pans, 2 inches deep; large sifter or sieve; electric stand mixer (preferred but optional), fitted with paddle attachment; offset metal spatula (for frosting cake)

Heat oven to 350 degrees F with racks in upper and lower third. Butter cake pans, then line bottoms with rounds of wax paper or parchment and butter the paper. Dust pans with additional flour and knock out excess.
Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.
Beat butter with sugar in a large bowl at medium-high speed (preferably using a stand mixer) until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and beat mixture 5 minutes more.
Reduce speed to low, then add flour mixture alternately with yogurt in 3 batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing just until smooth. Divide batter between pans (about 2 3/4 cups per pan), spreading evenly, then rap each pan on counter once or twice to eliminate air bubbles.
Bake layers, switching position of pans and rearranging them in oven halfway through baking time, until cake begins to pull away from side of pan and a wooden pick inserted in center of each comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes total for 9-inch pans and 20 to 25 minutes total for 8-inch pans.
Cool 10 minutes in pans on racks, then run a thin knife around edge of pans and invert layers onto racks to cool completely.
Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a heavy saucepan, then whisk in boiling-hot water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking, then reduce heat and simmer, whisking constantly, 1 minute (mixture will be thick).
Remove pan from heat and whisk in corn syrup. Add chocolates and vanilla, then stir once. Let stand 1 minute and stir again until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.
Transfer chocolate mixture to a metal bowl and set bowl in a larger bowl of ice water. Stir chocolate mixture until it has cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
With an electric mixer, beat in butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, until incorporated and frosting is light and holds soft peaks.
Put a layer, bottom side up, on a cake plate or stand. Spread 1 cup of frosting over top. Cover with another layer, bottom side up, and spread with another cup of frosting. Top with third layer, bottom side up.
Spread a thin layer of frosting around sides and over top of cake with offset spatula. (This is called crumb-coating. It tamps down any loose crumbs to keep them out of the top layer of frosting and fills in any crevices.) Chill or briefly freeze cake just until frosting is firm.
Spread sides and top of cake with remaining frosting.

3 ounces red candied cherries, coarsely chopped
3 ounces green candied cherries, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup (4 ounces) coarsely chopped pecans
2 large baking sheets; wax paper

Arrange two approximately 12- by 12-inch square pieces of wax paper on a work surface and spread half the flaked coconut in the middle of each.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the milk and vanilla or rum extract and beat until fully incorporated. With the mixer on low, add the flour in 3 batches, followed by the red and green cherries and the pecans, and stir until just combined, about 2 minutes. Divide the dough in half and form each half into a 10-inch-long log, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Transfer each log to a sheet of wax paper and roll to coat them in the coconut. Once the logs are completely covered in coconut, roll the wax paper around each log, cover in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and a second rack in the lower third then preheat to 375 degrees F.
Slice each log crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick cookies and arrange on baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between cookies. Bake, switching the baking sheets between the upper and lower racks about halfway through baking, until light golden brown, about 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Continue baking cookies on cooled baking sheets. DO AHEAD: The cookies can be baked ahead and stored, in an airtight container at room temperature, up to 3 days.

The Crows
3 large egg whites
3/4 cup milk
3/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 1/3 cups white all-purpose, cake, or pastry flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp (4 1/2 oz) unsalted butter, softened
Cornstarch for dusting
12 oz store-bought fondant, colored flesh-colored with 1 to 2 drops peach and a dab of blue paste food coloring
1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam
12 oz Half and Half , colored black with 36 drops black paste food coloring
1 oz Royal Icing , colored red with 4 drops red paste food coloring
60 Maggots

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-hole muffin pan with 12 large paper cupcake liners. Put the egg whites, 2 tablespoons of the milk, and the vanilla extract in a medium bowl and mix together with a fork.
2 Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Stir in the sugar. Add the butter and the remaining milk and, using an electric mixer, beat together until combined. Gradually beat in the egg white mixture. Spoon the batter into the paper liners. Bake for about 20 minutes, turning once halfway through baking, until well risen and firm to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
3 Dust the counter with cornstarch and roll out the fondant to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Using a 2 1/2 to 3-inch round cutter, cut out 12 circle s that will cover the cupcakes.
4 Use a teaspoon to create an indentation in the center of each cupcake and spoon 2 teaspoons raspberry jam into each. Cover each jam circle with a fondant circle.
5 To make the crows, divide the black Half & Half into 12 equal-size pieces. Reserving a tiny amount for the lower beak, roll one piece of the Half & Half into a ball. Squeeze and pinch the top of the ball to form the head. Squeeze, pinch, and flatten the other end of the ball to create the tail. From the head, squeeze and pinch out a long, pointy beak shape. Roll the reserved piece of Half & Half into another beak shape, but curving down at the tip. Attach below the upper beak with water, to make the beak appear open. Repeat to make another 11 crows.
6 With a craft knife, cut a long slit from just inside the edge of the fondant circle to 1/2 inch away from the edge on the opposite edge of the circle. Make a second cut that starts at the same point as the first and is the same length, but ends 1/4 inch apart from the first cut.
7 Pull up the fondant strip to expose the raspberry jam below, then use water to attach the point of the strip to the inside of the crow's beak.
8 Attach the crow to the fondant circle with water. If necessary, anchor the crow to the cupcake with a small piece of toothpick. Using a pastry bag or parchment paper cone fitted with a fine plain piping tip, pipe red Royal Icing eyes onto the crow. Use a craft knife to score crow footprints on the fondant. Place the Maggots in the raspberry jam. Repeat to decorate the remaining cupcakes.

1/2 pint (6 ounces) blackberries
2 or 3 (9-inch) round cake pans
large sifter or sieve
electric stand mixer (optional)
pastry brush
offset metal spatula (for frosting cake)

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, then line bottoms with rounds of wax paper. Butter paper and dust pans with some additional flour, knocking out excess.
Resift cake flour together with cocoa, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.
Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer (fitted with paddle attachment if using stand mixer) at medium-high speed until combined well, then add oil and beat until very pale and creamy, about 3 minutes.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, and beat in food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla extract.
Reduce speed to low and mix in flour mixture and sour cream mixture in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture, and mixing until batter is smooth.
Divide batter between pans (about 3 cups in each) and smooth tops. Rap pans on counter a couple of times to expel any air bubbles. Bake in middle of oven until a wooden pick comes out clean and cake begins to pull away from sides of pans, 25 to 30 minutes. Keep oven on.
Cool layers in pans on racks 10 minutes, then run a thin knife around edge of pans. Invert layers onto racks and peel off wax paper. Cool layers completely.
Butter one 9-inch round cake pan, then line bottom with wax paper. Butter paper and dust pan with some additional flour, knocking out excess.
Resift cake flour together with baking soda and salt into a bowl. Whisk egg whites in another bowl with sour cream mixture until combined.

Sift confectioners' sugar into a bowl and add to cream cheese mixture. Mix on low speed until incorporated, then increase speed to medium-high and beat until smooth.
Brush loose crumbs from cake layers with a pastry brush.
Put a red velvet layer, bottom side up, on a cake plate or stand. Spread 1 cup of frosting over layer. Cover with white layer, bottom side up, and spread with another cup of frosting. Top with second red velvet layer, bottom side up.
Spread a thin layer of frosting around sides and over top of cake. (This is called crumb-coating. It tamps down any loose crumbs to keep them out of the top layer of frosting and fills in any crevices. This is particularly important with red velvet cake layers.) Chill or briefly freeze cake just until frosting is firm.
Spread sides and top of cake with remaining frosting. Chill or briefly freeze cake just until frosting is firm.
Toss together fruits in a bowl. Let cake come to room temperature before serving and top with about 1 1/2 cups fruit. Serve remaining fruit on the side.

Chocolate-Praline Cake in a Jar
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups sifted cake flour
2/3 cup sour cream
2/3 cup brewed coffee (I just use the morning's leftover coffee)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup pecan halves or pieces
Ten to twelve 1/2-pint canning jars
Rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place 10 to 12 1/2-pint glass canning jars on a rimmed baking sheet, evenly arranged with space between them. (If you have a Silpat liner, place it under the jars to prevent them from sliding around.)
To make the cakes, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter until smooth. Add the brown sugar and eggs and mix until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla, cocoa, baking soda, and salt and mix until combined. Add half of the flour, then half of the sour cream, and mix until combined. Repeat with the remaining flour and sour cream. Drizzle in the coffee and mix until smooth. The batter will be thin, like heavy cream.
Pour the batter into the jars, filling them halfway. Bake until the tops of the cakes are firm to the touch, about 25 minutes.*
To make the topping, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then add the brown sugar and 1?2 cup water and stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the powdered sugar until combined, then return to the heat and bring to a boil. Stir in the nuts.
Pour the praline topping over the cakes to cover, working quickly, because the praline hardens quickly as it cools. Let the cakes cool completely if they aren't already, before screwing on jar lids.**
Do-Aheads
*The cakes can be made ahead, cooled, covered, and kept at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
**The finished cakes will keep for up to 4 days at room temperature.

Almond Cake
1/2 pound (1 3/4 cups) blanched whole almonds
6 large eggs, separated
1 1/4 cups superfine sugar
Grated zest of 1 orange
Grated zest of 1 lemon
4 drops almond extract
Confectioners' sugar for dusting

Finely grind the almonds in a food processor.
With an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar to a smooth pale cream. Beat in the zests and almond extract. Add the ground almonds and mix very well.
With clean beaters, beat the egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold them into the egg and almond mixture (the mixture is thick, so that you will need to turn it over quite a bit into the egg whites).
Grease an 11-inch springform pan, preferably nonstick, with butter and dust it with flour. Pour in the cake batter, and bake into a preheated 350 degrees F for 40 minutes, or until it feels firm to the touch. Let cool before turning out.
Just before serving, dust the top of the cake with confectioners' sugar. Or, if you like, cut a St. James cross out of paper. Place it in the middle of the cake, and dust the cake with confectioners' sugar, then remove the paper.

Rainbow Cookies
2 tablespoons plus 2 cups unsalted butter, cubed, at room temperature
6 large eggs, separated
1 1/3 cups sugar, divided
12 ounces almond paste (not marzipan), chopped
2 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon red food coloring
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup orange marmalade, heated, strained
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, melted
1 teaspoon green food coloring
3 13x9x2 inch metal baking pans

Preheat oven to 350 degrees  Line three 13x9x2 inch metal baking pans with foil, leaving overhang; grease with 2 tablespoon butter; set aside. Put egg whites in bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk; beat until soft peaks form. Slowly add 1/3 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Transfer to a large bowl; cover; chill. Using the paddle attachment, beat almond paste and remaining sugar on medium-low until incorporated, 4-5 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high; gradually add remaining butter. Beat until fluffy. Beat in yolks, then flour and salt. Fold in whites in 2 additions. Divide batter evenly among 3 bowls. Mix red coloring into 1 bowl and green coloring into second bowl; leave third bowl plain. Spread 1 bowl of batter into each prepared pan; smooth tops. Bake, rotating pans halfway through, until just set, 9-11 minutes. Let cool in pans.
With a pastry brush, spread half of marmalade over green cake. Using foil overhang, lift plain layer out of pan. Invert onto green layer; discard foil. Brush remaining marmalade over plain layer. Lift red layer out of pan; invert onto plain layer and cover cake with foil.
Top with a 13x9x2 inch pan. Weigh down pan with several heavy canned goods to compress cake layers. Refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
Remove cans, top pan, and foil. Transfer cake to a waxed paper-lined baking sheet.
Spread half of chocolate over cake in a thin layer. Freeze for 10 minutes. Cover with waxed paper, invert the baking sheet on top, and flip cake. Uncover and glaze with remaining chocolate. Freeze 10 additional minutes.
Trim cake to 12x8 inch. Cut crosswise into six 2 inch-wide strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 96 inch-wide cookies. Store in an airtight container.

Black Sesame Lace Cookies
7 tablespoons (7/8 stick/100 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
7 tablespoons (100 grams) packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup (70 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (80 grams) fresh orange juice (about 1 1/2 oranges)
3 tablespoons black sesame seeds

Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer or a wooden spoon), cream the butter until creamy and light, about 2 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar and continue to beat on medium speed for about 1 minute, or until combined. Turn the speed down to low and add the flour and mix until well combined. Slowly drizzle in the orange juice and mix for about 30 seconds; the mixture will look a little broken, which is okay. Mix in the sesame seeds.
Transfer the batter to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or for up to 1 week.
When ready to bake cookies, position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a very flat baking sheet with parchment paper. (This batter spreads like crazy, so you have to use an extremely flat baking sheet in order for the cookies to bake in circles and not amoeba-like shapes.)
Pinch off rounded tablespoon-size balls of dough and place on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart to allow for spreading.
Bake for 16 to 18 minutes, or until the cookies are completely golden brown throughout. Let cool completely (they must be firm to the touch) on the baking sheet on a wire rack. Gently remove the cookies from the parchment.
The cookies can be stored, in layers separated with sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper, in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Key Lime Pudding Cakes
6 (6-ounce) ramekins or custard cups
Electric stand mixer or a handheld mixer and medium bowl
Rubber spatula
9- by 13-inch baking pan that will hold the ramekins
2 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup Key lime juice
1/4 cup sliced almonds

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and put the oven rack in the middle of the oven.
2. Grease the insides of the ramekins with nonstick cooking spray or butter and evenly coat with the 2 tablespoons sugar (see headnote). Separate the eggs into 2 bowls.
3. Using the stand mixer, or a handheld mixer and medium bowl, first on low speed and then gradually increasing the speed to medium, beat the butter and the 1/2 cup sugar together until smooth. Scrape down the side of the bowl with the rubber spatula. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition, stopping once or twice to scrape down the side of the bowl. Reduce the speed to medium-low, add the flour and salt, and mix until everything is evenly combined. Mix in the milk, 1/3 cup at a time. Then, by hand, stir in the Key lime juice. The batter will be thin. Set aside while you whip the egg whites.
4. With a handheld or stand mixer, whisk the egg whites in a clean dry bowl on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until the whites hold a peak on the whisk or beaters (stop the mixer and lift to check).
5. Using the rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the Key lime mixture. Using a measuring cup to scoop up the batter evenly, divide it among the ramekins so it comes to within 1/4 inch of the rims.
6. It's best to find a space near your oven to fill the baking pan with water so you don't have to walk too far. Place the ramekins in the baking pan and, using a container with a spout, slowly pour very hot tap water into the pan so that the water comes about half the way up the sides of the ramekins. Carefully transfer the baking pan to the oven. Bake the puddings until some begin to turn golden brown and have cracked slightly on the surface, about 40 minutes.
7. Remove the baking pan from the oven. Let cool until you can pick up the ramekins (15 minutes or so), then remove them from the water.
8. Spread the almonds in one layer in a small baking pan and put it in the still-warm oven. Set a timer for 10 minutes and check the nuts to see if they're a light golden brown. If not, toast 2 minutes longer. Set aside to cool.
9. Serve the cakes warm or at room temperature, the almonds scattered on top just before serving.

Hills Family Sugar Cookie Cutouts
3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 egg white
Pinch of salt
A few drops of vegetable oil
Up to 1 pound of confectioners' sugar
1 to 3 tablespoons of cream
If using egg whites: 3 large egg whites at room temperature and 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
If using meringue powder: 3 tablespoons meringue powder and 6 tablespoons warm water
3 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar
Optional: 1 to 2 drops of glycerin
Food coloring

Sift the flour with baking powder and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter for a full minute, then add the sugar and beat at medium speed until light, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy and very light, another 2 to 4 minutes. With a wooden spoon gradually work the flour into the creamed mixture. Divide the dough into two portions and wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least several hours or overnight.
Heat the oven to 400 degrees . On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick, using more flour for the rolling pin, sprinkled on the dough, and additionally on the floured surface as needed to prevent sticking. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters and place on cookie sheets.
This dough works beautifully if gathered and rerolled; if it gets too soft, chill for about 15 minutes.
Refrigerate or freeze the cut-out cookies on their baking sheets for 10 to 15 minutes so they will retain their firm edges as they bake; if you're in a hurry, go ahead and bake the cookies immediately. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes or until cookies are puffed and only just barely starting to brown at the edges: Start with the shortest amount of time and watch carefully, especially with very small cookies. As the cookies are fragile right out of the oven, let cool slightly before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
When cool, glaze and decorate as desired.
Makes up to 6 dozen cookies, depending on the size. This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.
Whisk the egg white and salt until loosened and beginning to foam. Add oil, confectioners' sugar, and cream gradually and whisk, adding more sugar and cream until the glaze is of spreading consistency: You want it to be thin enough to spread easily over the cookies to their edges, but not so thin it runs off the sides.
Using an offset spatula or a smooth table knife, spread the glaze over each cookie, filling in the shape to its edges. While the glaze is wet, you can decorate the cookies with colored sprinkles, or leave the glaze plain, let dry, and add more decoration with Royal Icing.
Before you start, make sure that all utensils and containers are clean and grease-free. Have ready several small containers for dividing the icing and tinting it with different colors, if desired. You will need to keep the royal icing covered with a damp cloth, plastic wrap, or tight fitting lid or it will dry out. Royal icing will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for about one week. This recipe is proportioned for the firmest-textured icing; adjust the texture with the addition of water or sugar as explained below.
If using egg whites, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar, and sugar and beat until the icing is thick and holds billowy peaks, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add glycerin for extra shine, if desired.
If using meringue powder, whisk the meringue powder and sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the water and beat on low speed for about 5 minutes, until icing is thick and holds billowy peaks. Don't overbeat or the icing texture will become hard to work with. Add glycerin for extra shine, if desired. To adjust the consistency of icing: To thicken, add sifted confectioners' sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking thoroughly until you reach the desired consistency. To thin, add warm water a few drops at a time, mixing with a spoon. Piped outlines and details require the thickest icing; flows of color over a whole cookie or in sections can be somewhat thinner.
Royal icing hardens very quickly when exposed to air, so cover with a damp cloth, plastic wrap, or container lids when not in immediate use.
Divide the icing into separate containers for each color to be used. Tint the icing with small amounts of food coloring until it reaches the color desired.
To use, icing can be spread onto cookies with an offset spatula or table knifeâeven painted on with small, previously unused paintbrushes, such as the ones that come in a child's paint boxâor it can be piped through a pastry bag and tips. For simple, plain outlines, use a zipper plastic bag with a tiny hole cut from one corner.
Makes about 3 cups of icing.

Brown SugarâGinger Cream Cake
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup maple sugar, dark muscovado, or organic dark brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Butter and flour a loaf pan or an 8-inch springform pan. If using a loaf pan, line the bottom and ends with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine the flours, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and whisk them together. Make a well in the middle.
Using the whisk attachment of an electric mixer, beat the eggs until foamy, then add the cream, sugar, and flavorings. Beat until you have what looks like soft whipped cream. (If using maple sugar, the cream may not thicken, but the cake will still work.) Pour the mixture into the center of the flour mixture and whisk together just until well combined and free of lumps. Scrape the batter into the pan and even it out.
Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes, then remove the rim or turn the cake out of the pan and remove the paper. Cool before slicing.

Pastry bag
1/4-inch-diameter plain pastry tip
Heavy-duty stand mixer
Candy thermometer

Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Sift powdered sugar, almond flour, and hazelnut flour (if using) into large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, sugar, and pinch of salt in medium bowl until medium peaks form. Add egg white mixture to almond mixture; fold to incorporate. Working in 2 batches, fill pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch-diameter plain pastry tip with batter (batter will be thin and will drip from bag). Pipe batter in 11/4-inch rounds on baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart (cookies will spread slightly). Let rest on sheets at room temperature 20 minutes. Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Bake cookies 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Continue to bake cookies until puffed and golden on top, about 10 minutes, reversing sheets after 5 minutes. Cool cookies on sheets on rack. Carefully peel cookies from parchment. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
Bring raspberries and 1 cup sugar to boil in large saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook until berries are soft, juices thicken, and mixture measures about 1 1/2 cups, stirring frequently, 7 to 9 minutes. Measure 1/2 cup mixture; strain into small bowl. Cool strained jam and jam with seeds separately. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover jams separately and chill.
Combine egg whites, 6 tablespoons sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl of heavy- duty stand mixer. Set bowl over large saucepan of simmering water. Heat until candy thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140 degrees F, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. Using whisk attachment, beat egg white mixture at high speed until stiff meringue forms and mixture is at room temperature, 5 to 6 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, 1 piece at a time, beating until each piece is incorporated before adding next. Beat in rose water. Add 3 tablespoons seedless jam, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating to blend well after each addition. (If buttercream looks broken or curdled, place bowl over medium heat and whisk 5 to 10 seconds to warm slightly, then remove from heat and beat again on medium speed. Repeat warming and beating as many times as needed until buttercream is smooth.)
Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Using 1/2 teaspoon jam with seeds for each, spread jam over flat side of half of macaroons. Spoon buttercream into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain tip. Starting at outer edge of flat sides of remaining macaroons, pipe buttercream over in spiral. Gently press macaroons, jam- filled side down, onto buttercream-coated macaroons. Place on sheet. Cover; chill overnight. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 to 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container in refrigerator. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.

Sandwich Cookies with Chocolate Ganache Filling
Sugar Cookie Dough
6 tablespoons bittersweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup half-and-half

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut dough in half; roll out both halves to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out cookies with a round 1-inch cookie cutter, rerolling scraps to get 72 cookies. Coat 2 cookie sheets with cooking spray; place cookies on sheets 1 inch apart and bake 1 batch at a time until firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Simmer chocolate chips and half-and-half in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring once or twice, until chocolate melts and is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes; remove from heat. Let cool 1 minute. Spread 1/2 teaspoon chocolate ganache on a cookie; press a second cookie on top to form a sandwich. Repeat with remaining cookies and ganache.

Fudgy Meringue Cookies
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips (do not exceed 61% cacao; about 6 ounces), divided

Minty Mini-Doughnuts
Sugar Cookie Dough
Vegetable oil cooking spray
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon skim milk
2 Medium candy canes, crushed

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 2 cookie sheets with cooking spray. Cut dough into 4 equal pieces; cut each into 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece between fingers to form a 1 1/2-to 2-inch-long log. Pinch together ends of each log to form rings and place doughnuts 1 inch apart on cookie sheets; bake 1 batch at a time until dough puffs, 5 to 6 minutes. Whisk sugar and milk in a bowl until smooth. Dip top of each warm cookie into sugar-milk glaze; press into crushed candy. Let set on wire racks.

Florentines
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/4 cups finely chopped almonds
3/4 cup finely chopped candied orange peel
1/3 cup flour

In a saucepan, mix together 1/2 cup each of heavy cream and sugar and 3 tablespoons butter and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove it from the heat and stir in 1 1/4 cups finely chopped almonds, 3/4 cup finely chopped candied orange peel, and 1/3 cup flour. Drop the batter from a tablespoon into mounds about 3 inches apart on oiled and lightly floured cookie sheets and flatten each cookie with a wet spatula. Bake the cookies in a moderate oven (350 degrees F) for about 10 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them stand for about 5 minutes. Remove the cookies to a wire rack, let them cool completely, and spread them with chocolate glaze. Chill them.
Melt 1 ounce each of unsweetened chocolate and sweet cooking chocolate over simmering water. Add 2 tablespoons butter and 1 teaspoon honey and stir the glaze until the butter is melted. For an easier glaze, use melted bittersweet chocolate.

Triple-Ginger Cookies
2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup solid vegetable shortening (preferably non-hydrogenated)
1/4 cup mild-flavored (light) molasses
1 large egg
2 teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger
1/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger
Raw sugar (for rolling)
Ingredient info: Look for raw sugar (also called turbinado or demerara sugar) at most supermarkets and at natural foods stores.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Whisk first 5 ingredients and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and shortening in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in molasses, egg, and fresh ginger. Stir in crystallized ginger, then dry ingredients.
Fill small shallow bowl with raw sugar. Using moist hands, shape 1 teaspoonful dough into ball; roll in raw sugar. Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing cookies 2 inches apart.
Bake cookies until golden and dry-looking, about 15 minutes. Cool on sheets.

Monster Pops
48 uncoated Basic Cake Balls , chilled
64 ounces (4 pounds) purple candy coating
Deep, microwave-safe plastic bowl
48 paper lollipop sticks
Styrofoam block
Large squeeze bottle
White candy writer
Chocolate jimmies
Blue edible-ink pen
Black edible-ink pen

Have the cake balls chilled and in the refrigerator.
Melt the purple candy coating in a microwave-safe plastic bowl, following the instructions on the package. The coating should be about 3 inches deep for easier dipping. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)
When you are ready to dip, remove a few cake balls at a time from the refrigerator, keeping the rest chilled.
One at a time, dip about 1/2 inch of the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted candy coating, and insert the stick straight into a cake ball, pushing it no more than halfway through. Dip the cake pop into the melted coating, and tap off any excess coating. Hold the pop over the bowl in one hand, and tap your wrist gently with your other hand. If you use the hand holding the cake pop to shake off excess coating, the force of the movement will be too strong and could cause the cake ball to loosen or fly off the lollipop stick. Tapping the wrist holding the cake pop absorbs some of the impact. The excess coating will fall off, but you will need to rotate the lollipop stick so the coating doesn't build up on one side, making it too heavy on that side. If too much coating starts to build up at the base of the stick, simply use your finger to wipe it off, spinning the lollipop stick at the same time. This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.
Let dry in a Styrofoam block.
Pour the remaining purple coating into a large squeeze bottle, and pipe random, drizzled lines all around the monster head. Let dry completely in the Styrofoam block.
On some of the pops, pipe two small white circles with a candy writer for the eyes, and insert 2 chocolate jimmies before the coating sets.
On the remaining pops, pipe a single large, white circle. Let dry completely and draw a large blue circle inside the white circle, using a blue edible-ink pen. With a black edible-ink pen, outline the circle and draw a pupil to finish the eye.
Let dry completely.
You can also use melted white candy coating for the eyes.

Double Chocolate-Peppermint Crunch Cookies
2 1/2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips (do not exceed 61% cacao; 15 to 16 ounces), divided
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
2 large eggs
4 candy canes or 16 red-and-white- striped hard peppermint candies, coarsely crushed

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Stir 2 cups chocolate chips in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Measure 2/3 cup melted chocolate; transfer to small metal bowl and reserve for drizzling.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, espresso powder, and salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until creamy. Add sugar and both extracts; beat until smooth. Add eggs; beat to blend. Beat in melted chocolate from medium bowl. Add dry ingredients; beat just to blend. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Measure 1 level tablespoonful dough; roll dough between palms to form ball. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing cookies 1 1/2 inches apart.
Bake cookies until cracked all over and tester inserted into center comes out with large moist crumbs attached, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes. Transfer cookies on parchment paper to racks to cool completely.
Rewarm reserved 2/3 cup chocolate over small saucepan of simmering water. Using fork, drizzle chocolate over cookies. Sprinkle crushed candy canes over, arranging some pieces with red parts showing. Chill just until chocolate sets, about 20 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 weeks ahead. Store airtight in freezer. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Chocolate-Toffee Shortbread Fingers
1/2 cup toasted and cooled pecans, coarsely chopped
3/4 cup Heath Bits 'O Brickle Toffee bits or Skor or Heath bars, coarsely chopped
1 bag (12 ounces) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 packages (8.8-ounces each) Walkers Pure Butter Shortbread Fingers

1. Line a few baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the nuts and toffee bits in a shallow bowl.
2. Combine the chocolate and oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat the chocolate in the microwave on high until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute depending on the strength of your microwave. Stir until smooth. (Alternatively, place water to a depth of 1 inch in the bottom of a double boiler or a large saucepan and bring to a bare simmer. Place the chocolate chips and oil in the top of the double boiler or in a stainless steel bowl big enough to rest on top of the saucepan without touching the water. Heat, whisking occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.)
3. Hold a cookie by one end and dip it into the chocolate, turning, to coat three quarters of the cookie; let the excess drip back into the bowl. Hold the cookie over the bowl of nuts and toffee bits and sprinkle some of the mixture onto the chocolate-coated top and sides of the cookie. Place the cookie on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Let the cookies rest until the chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.
Chocolate-Toffee Shortbread Fingers will keep, between layers of parchment paper, in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week
To toast the pecans, place them in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet and bake in a 350 degrees F oven, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Watch them closely to make sure they don't burn, and transfer the toasted nuts to a plate to let them cool.

World Peace Cookies
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1/3 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
11 tablespoons (1 stick plus 3 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature
2/3 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
5 ounces extra-bittersweet chocolate (do not exceed 85% cacao), chopped (no pieces bigger than 1/3 inch)

Sift flour, cocoa, and baking soda into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until smooth but not fluffy. Add both sugars, vanilla, and sea salt; beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add flour mixture; beat just until blended (mixture may be crumbly). Add chopped chocolate; mix just to distribute (if dough doesn't come together, knead lightly in bowl to form ball). Divide dough in half. Place each half on sheet of plastic wrap. Form each into 1 1/2-inch-diameter log. Wrap each in plastic; chill until firm, about 3 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using thin sharp knife, cut logs crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Space 1 inch apart on prepared sheets. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies appear dry (cookies will not be firm or golden at edges), 11 to 12 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Teddie's Apple Cake
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups peanut, vegetable, or corn oil
2 cups sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups peeled, cored, and thickly sliced apples
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins
Vanilla ice cream for serving (optional)

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9-inch tube pan. Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda.
2. Beat the oil and sugar together in a mixer with a paddle (or in a bowl with a hand mixer) for 5 minutes. Add the eggs and beat until the mixture is creamy. Stir in the dry ingredients. Add the vanilla, apples, walnuts, and raisins and stir until combined.
3. Turn the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan before turning out.
4. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
If mixing the batter in a mixer, use a paddle attachment and turn the speed to low once you add the flour mixture, or the texture of the cake will be tough. Even better, mix the rest by hand.
The recipe called for Red Delicious or McIntosh apples, but I'd recommend a variety that's brighter in flavor and firmer in texture, such as a Honeycrisp, Macoun, or Granny Smith.
The apple slices can be halved if you want a more uniform texture.
This cake can be eaten at any time of day, including breakfast. If you serve it for dessert, the recipe suggested a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. I prefer to whip 1/2 cup of heavy cream to soft peaks, then fold in crÃ¨me fraÃ®che to taste.
 inchI most recently baked this cake for Thanksgiving 2004. There was a small piece left over and several days later (it keeps beautifully), I wrapped it in aluminum foil and took it to NYC for my son and daughter-in-law. He took it from me and started looking around his kitchen. When I questioned him, he said he had to hide it from his wife. inch

Easy Cranberry & Apple Cake
12 ounces fresh cranberries, rinsed and picked over for stems
1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and medium-diced
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon grated orange zest (2 oranges)
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 1/8 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup sour cream
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Combine the cranberries, apple, brown sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs on medium-high speed for 2 minutes. With the mixer on medium, add 1 cup of the granulated sugar, the butter, vanilla, and sour cream and beat just until combined. On low speed, slowly add the flour and salt.
Pour the fruit mixture evenly into a 10-inch glass pie plate. Pour the batter over the fruit, covering it completely. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar and 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon and sprinkle it over the batter. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a tooth-pick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean and the fruit is bubbling around the edges. Serve warm or at room temperature.

M'hanncha (Snake Cake)
3 cups almonds
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
2 egg yolks, beaten
1 tablespoon orange-flower water
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 (12- by 17-inch) sheets phyllo dough
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
2 egg yolks, beaten
1 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup sliced almonds

Combine the almonds, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom in a food processor or blender and pulse to grind into a coarse meal. Add the butter and egg yolks and pulse until blended. Scrape the paste into a bowl, and stir in the orange-flower water, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla. Divide the paste into 12 balls, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Set the balls on a work surface dusted with confectioners' sugar. Roll each one into a 3 1/2-inch-long log. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a large baking sheet. Dust a work surface with confectioners' sugar. Place a sheet of phyllo pastry on the sugared work surface, and fold it in thirds to form a 4- by 17-inch rectangle. Brush the sheet with melted butter. Add another folded phyllo sheet, brush with butter, and repeat, until you have four buttered sheets.
Set four orange-almond paste logs in a row down one long end of the phyllo, and roll the pastry up over them into a cylinder. Fold over the ends and brush on some melted butter to seal the seams. Shape the cylinder into a small, tight coil and place on the baking sheet, seam side down.
Repeat to prepare two more phyllo rolls. Add each to the end of the coil on the baking sheet, forming a large coil.
Combine the egg yolks, water, and cinnamon. Brush the mixture over the top of the cake.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden. Remove the cake from the oven, and let cool on the baking sheet.
Stir together the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle on the cake, and top with sliced almonds.

Stained-Glass Ornaments
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
3/4 cup unsulfured molasses
1/3 cup water
6 ounces translucent hard candies in colors of choice, crushed

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar and molasses and beat for 2 minutes. Beat in the water. On low speed, beat in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms.
3. Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with aluminum foil.
5. Divide the dough into thirds. Divide each third into 10 equal pieces. Using your palms, roll each piece on a lightly floured work surface into a rope 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. Gently trace the design of your choice onto the prepared cookie sheets (a wooden spoon handle or chopstick works well for tracing on foil). Outline each design with a rope of dough, pressing the ends together to seal securely.
6. Sprinkle the inside of each design with the crushed candies, dividing the candies evenly among the outlined designs and creating an even layer.
7. Bake in the center of the oven or until the edges of the cookies are golden and the candy has melted, 6 to 9 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheets on wire racks until the candy hardens, about 5 minutes. Gently peel the foil away from the cookies and transfer to the racks to cool completely.

Mrs. Stein's Chocolate Cake
Softened unsalted butter and flour, for the pan
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 1/3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 ounce (1/2 square) unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 3/4 cups superfine sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 large eggs, at room temperature, beaten
Confectioners' sugar, for garnish, optional

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour the inside of a 8 to 10-cup fluted tube pan and tap out the excess flour.
2. Combine the milk and lemon juice in a glass measuring cup. Let stand in a warm place (near the preheating oven) while preparing the rest of the batter; the milk will curdle. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together into a medium bowl.
3. Bring 1/2 inch of water to a simmer in a small saucepan, and turn off the heat. Place the chocolate in a custard cup or ramekin and set in the hot water. Let stand until the chocolate is melted, then remove from the water, being careful not to splash any water into the chocolate, and stir until smooth. Let stand until tepid.
4. Beat the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in the sugar, then add the vanilla. Beat until the mixture is very light in color and texture, scraping occasionally, about 4 minutes. Gradually beat in the eggs. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Beat in the cooled chocolate. In thirds, alternating with two equal additions of the milk mixture, add the flour mixture, scraping down the bowl and beating until smooth after each addition. Spoon the batter into the pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
5. Bake until the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed with your finger, and a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert and unmold the cake onto the rack and cool completely. Sift a light coating of confectioners' sugar on top, if using. (The cake can be stored at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.)

SablÃ© Galette Cookies
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup (2 sticks) parve margarine, cut into tablespoons
Dash of salt
1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar, divided
2 large egg yolks, divided
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons orange blossom water (optional)
1 tablespoon cold water plus 1/2 tablespoon water, divided

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the flour, margarine, salt and 1/2 cup of the sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse about seven times, or until the mixture looks like sand. You can also do this by hand in a large bowl with two knives or a pastry cutter. Add 1 egg yolk, the vanilla, orange blossom water, if using, and the tablespoon of cold water. Process or mix just until the dough comes together.
2. Place a large piece of parchment on the counter and grease lightly using the paper or foil wrapper that wrapped the margarine. Dump the dough onto the greased parchment and, using a rolling pin, roll into a large circle, about 9 inches in diameter.
3. To decorate the edge of the cookie, using the flat end of the handle of a wooden spoon, or the tip of your index finger, make indentations one after the other all around the outside of the circle.
4. Whisk together the remaining egg yolk with the 1/2 tablespoon of water. Brush the top of the cookie with egg wash. Using the tines of a fork, make one set of lines straight across the top of the cookie. Make another set about 2 inches below the first. Repeat until you have four to five sets of lines. Now slide the parchment a quarter turn to the right and make four to five additional sets of lines, each about 2 inches apart. The new set of lines should cross the first set of lines on an angle, creating a diamond-shaped grid.
5. Sprinkle the top of the cookie with the remaining teaspoon of sugar. Slide the parchment onto a cookie sheet and bake for 35 to 37 minutes, until the edges start to look golden. Remove from the oven and immediately cut the cookie into 8 or 12 large wedges or about eighteen 1 x 3-inch bars, if you like. If you wait until the cookie cools to cut it, you will not get nice clean edges.

Maple and Chocolate Chip Shortbread
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus additional for pan

1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
About 3/4 cup prepared poppy-seed, apricot, or prune filling or thick jam of choice
Sifted confectioners' sugar for dusting

1. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat together the cream cheese, butter, and sugar on medium speed until light, about 2 minutes. On low speed, gradually beat in the flour just until mixed. The dough will be soft and sticky.
2. Divide the dough in half. Pat each half into a thick disk and wrap separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm enough to handle, at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease or spray cookie sheets.
4. Dust a pastry cloth or board with flour or confectioners' sugar. Remove 1 dough disk from the refrigerator and place it on the pastry cloth. Keep the remaining dough disk refrigerated. Roll out the dough into a square or rectangle 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares.
5. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each square. Pull 2 opposite corners of the square into the middle, and pinch the edges together to seal. Place the cookies on the prepared cookie sheets, spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
6. Bake in the center of the oven until lightly golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the cookie sheets for 1 to 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks. Dust the tops with sifted confectioners' sugar while still warm, then let cool completely.

Toffee Squares
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
7 to 8 ounces milk chocolate, broken into pieces, or 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips
1 cup chopped almonds, toasted

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment.
2. Prepare the crust. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed until light, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolk, vanilla, and salt. On low speed, gradually beat in the flour just until mixed. The dough will be stiff. Pat the dough evenly over the bottom of the baking pan.
3. Bake in the center of the oven until pale gold on top, about 20 minutes.
4. Remove the pan from the oven and scatter the chocolate pieces evenly over the crust. Return the pan to the oven for 1 minute. Remove the pan again and, using a knife, spread the chocolate evenly over the crust. Sprinkle evenly with the almonds.
5. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Using a sharp knife, cut into small squares, then carefully remove from the pan with a small offset spatula or an icing spatula.

3/4 cup (120 g) dried currants
1/4 cup (60 ml) brandy or whiskey
2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 2/3 cups (355 g) granulated sugar
3/4 cup (6 ounces/170 g) unsalted butter, melted
1 1/2 cups (375 ml) persimmon purÃ©e
3 large eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups (150 g) walnuts or pecans, toasted and finely chopped
4 ounces (115 g) cream cheese
1 tablespoon salted butter, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
2/3 cup (90 g) powdered sugar, sifted
4 or 5 teaspoons water

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 10-cup (2.5-liter) Bundt cake or tube pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray.
To make the cake, in a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the currants and brandy or whiskey to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and let cool.
Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg. Stir in the granulated sugar. In a medium bowl, mix together the 3/4 cup (6 ounces/170 g) melted butter, persimmon purÃ©e, eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla.
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, add the persimmon mixture, and gently stir. Fold in the currants, along with any unabsorbed liquid, and the nuts. Mix just until everything is moistened; don't overmix.
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. Once cool, invert the cake onto a serving plate.

Roulade au Chocolat Pour Julia
1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, separated
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 egg whites
Chocolate-hazelnut mousse

1. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter or coat with vegetable spray a baking tray, 12 x 17 x 2 inches. Line with parchment paper and then spray the paper. Set aside.
2. Sift together 1 cup of the sugar, the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In the large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or beaters, beat the egg yolks at high speed. Turn the machine to low and pour in the oil, water, and vanilla. Gradually add the sifted ingredients and, when almost incorporated, turn the speed to medium and beat until well combined.
4. In another clean large bowl, with whip or clean beaters, whip the 6 egg whites until soft peaks form. Start on medium speed and raise the speed as the peaks begin to form. Gradually pour in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue to whip until the whites are shiny and firm, but not stiff. With a rubber spatula, fold one-quarter of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then scrape the chocolate mixture back into the whites, quickly folding until completely incorporated.
5. Scrape into the prepared pan and spread with an offset spatula, smoothing and leveling the top. Bake until the edges of the cake pull away from the pan and the cake springs back when lightly pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack.
6. When completely cool, place the pan on a firm surface. With a sharp knife, cut around the outside edges of the entire cake, separating the cake from the pan. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar over the surface of the cake (to prevent sticking when you invert the cake). Invert a second baking tray on the top of the cake and flip the cake over onto the second tray. Carefully peel off the parchment paper, turn the paper over, and place back on the cake. Invert the cake and the paper so that the paper is on the baking tray and the sugared side is on top. You are now ready to spread the filling onto the cake.
7. Fill and roll the cake: Place the cake with one of the 17-inch sides directly in front of you. Using your spatula, spread 11 2 cups of the Chocolate-Hazelnut Mousse over the surface of the cake to the edge of three of the sides, leaving about a 1-inch space along the one side directly in front of you (see photo). Level the filling. Refrigerate the remaining mousse, covered.
8. Starting with the 17-inch side in front of you, using the parchment paper to help you, roll the cake toward the opposite side, completely enclosing the filling (see photo). Make certain that you do not roll the paper into the cake. Tuck the paper around the rolled cake to secure (see photo). Leave the cake on the pan and refrigerate until the filling is firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight.
9. To serve, remove the cake from the refrigerator and unroll out of the paper onto a firm surface. Using a long serrated knife, cut a 2-inch diagonal piece off each end. With a #3 star tip fitted into a pastry bag, pipe 10 or 12 rosettes of mousse spaced evenly across the tip of the cake. Dust with sifted confectioners' sugar. Carefully transfer to a serving platter and refrigerate until needed. When ready to serve, cut into 10 or 12 portions. Pass the remaining mousse.

Chocolate Raspberry Layer Cake
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
2 cups unbleached all purpose flour
1 3/4 cups sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
3/4 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 large eggs
18 ounces bittersweet chocolate (do not exceed 61% cacao), chopped
2 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream
6 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam, stirred to loosen, divided
2 6-ounce containers fresh raspberries
Powdered sugar
2 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides

Position racks in top and bottom third of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Line bottoms with parchment paper rounds; spray rounds. Sift flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into large bowl; whisk to blend and form well in center. Whisk 1 cup water, buttermilk, oil, and eggs in medium bowl to blend. Pour wet ingredients into well in dry ingredients; whisk just to blend. Divide cake batter between prepared pans (about 3 cups each).
Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. (If cakes form domes, place kitchen towel atop hot cakes, then press gently with palm of hand to level.) Cool completely in pans on cooling racks. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover cakes in pans and let stand at room temperature.
Place chopped chocolate in medium bowl. Bring cream just to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Pour over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then stir until ganache is melted and smooth. Transfer 1 1/4 cups ganache to small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ganache is thick enough to spread, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Let remaining ganache stand at room temperature to cool until barely lukewarm.
Place rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Carefully run knife around pan edges to release cakes. Invert 1 cake layer onto cardboard round or bottom of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Peel off parchment paper. Place cake layer on round on prepared rack. Spread 3 tablespoons jam over top. Spoon dollops of chilled ganache over, then spread evenly. Invert second cake layer onto another cardboard round or tart pan bottom. Peel off parchment paper. Carefully slide cake off round and onto frosted cake layer on rack. Spread remaining 3 tablespoons raspberry jam over top of second cake layer. Pour half of barely lukewarm ganache over cake, spreading over sides to cover. Freeze until ganache sets, about 30 minutes. Pour remaining ganache over cake, allowing to drip down sides and spreading over sides if needed for even coverage and to smooth edges. Freeze to set ganache, about 30 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover with cake dome and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before continuing.
Arrange raspberries in concentric circles atop cake. Sift powdered sugar lightly over raspberries and serve.
A two-step process ensures a picture-perfect dessert. First, a thin layer of ganache is spread over the cake and chilled briefly to set (this is called a crumb coat). Another layer of ganache is then poured over the cake, which gives the treat a smooth finish.

Cassata Cake
2 ounces (1/4 cup) all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter
8 ounces (1 cup) superfine granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon citrus oil (pure orange or lemon oil)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup ricotta cheese
9 ounces (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 eggs, separated
16 ounces (2 cups) superfine granulated sugar, divided
8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter
1 pint fresh strawberries, washed, hulled, and sliced
4 cups whipped cream

1. To make the filling, quickly whisk together 4 tablespoons of the milk with the flour. The slurry will be somewhat thick, so whisk thoroughly to make it smooth. Press out any lumps with a flexible spatula, if necessary.
2. Whisk in the rest of the milk and transfer the mixture to a 2-quart heavy-bottom saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Once bubbles that burp steam form, remove the pot from the heat and continue to stir for another 30 seconds.
3. Cover the milk mixture with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Cool for 15 to 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine the butter, sugar, citrus oil, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on high speed for up to 5 minutes.
5. Add the milk mixture and continue to beat on high speed until the filling is smooth, another 5 minutes. Beat in the ricotta cheese 1 tablespoon at a time.
6. Preheat the oven to 335 degrees F and place the rack in the middle position. Line the bottoms of three 9-by-2- inch round pans with parchment.
7. Measure the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt into one bowl, and the milk and vanilla into a separate bowl. Whisk each to combine.
8. In the standing mixer fitted with the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed to a stiff peak. Drizzle in 1 cup of the sugar while the mixer is running. Scoop the meringue into a large bowl and set aside.
9. Lightly wipe the mixer bowl and replace the wire whip with the paddle attachment. Cream the butter with the remaining 1 cup of sugar on low speed.
10. Add the egg yolks one at a time. Scrape the sides of the bowl all the way to the bottom using a flexible spatula and mix on low speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
11. Alternately add the dry and wet ingredients about a quarter at a time without pausing between additions.
12. Stop the mixer and gently fold the meringue into the batter with a flexible spatula. Pour the mixture evenly into the prepared pans and bake for 27 to 30 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
13. Cool the cakes for 2 minutes, then run an offset spatula around the edges and invert the cakes onto a flat surface. They will be very fragile, so handle them with care.
14. Assemble the extravagant cake by adding about 1 cup each of the fresh strawberries and the ricotta filling between the layers. Cover the outside of the cake with the whipped cream. Add more fresh strawberries around the edge of the cake if you like.

Tennessee Mountain Stack Cake
21 ounces (4 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) superfine granulated sugar
3/4 cup molasses
2 eggs
1/2 cup buttermilk
8 to 12 cups dried apples
2 pounds (4 cups) superfine granulated sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 teaspoons nutmeg
2 tablespoons molasses
3 cups water
Confectioners' sugar

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the rack in the middle position.
2. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.
3. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until wet and grainy.
4. Add the molasses. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula to get all of the molasses into the mixture.
5. Add the eggs one at a time. Scrape all the way to the bottom of the bowl and mix on low speed.
6. Alternately add the buttermilk and the dry mixture about a quarter at a time. Stop the mixer to scrape the bowl and turn it on again on low speed for about 10 seconds. The mixture should be stiff like a soft cookie dough.
7. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
8. Divide the dough into 6 or 8 equal portions and place each one on a round piece of parchment paper a little larger than a 9-inch cake pan. Roll out the dough to the size of the parchment. Place the cake pan over the disk and trim away the excess around the edge.
9. Leaving the parchment paper underneath, lift the disks onto baking sheets and bake them for approximately 10 minutes, or until the top surface appears dry and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
10. Slide the disks off the baking sheet onto a flat surface to cool.
11. To make the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy-bottom saucepan and bring to a light simmer. Immediately transfer to the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse into a thick paste.
12. To assemble the cake, spread about 1 cup of the filling onto each layer, taking care to center each disk on top of the one beneath it. Repeat until all the layers are used. Do not put apple filling on top of the cake.
13. Wrap the cake well and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. This gives the apple filling time to work itself into the cake. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve chilled.

Ingredient info: Dried hibiscus flowers, also called jamaica flowers, are available at some natural foods stores and at Latin markets. Look for sweetened cream of coconut in the liquor section of most supermarkets.
Test-kitchen tip: When you're reducing the hibiscus sauce, spoon a bit of the hot sauce on a chilled plate to see how thick it will be when it is refrigerated.

Bring 2 cups water to boil in small saucepan. Stir in hibiscus flowers. Remove from heat; let steep uncovered 10 minutes.
Pour hibiscus mixture through fine-mesh sieve set over bowl, pressing on solids to extract all liquid; discard solids. Return hibiscus liquid to same saucepan. Add sugar; bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil gently over medium heat until liquid is reduced to 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon peel, lime peel, and orange peel; steep 10 minutes. Strain sauce into bowl. Cover; chill until cold, at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl. Whisk buttermilk, egg whites, and coconut extract in another medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk mixture in 2 additions, beating to blend well between additions and occasionally scraping bottom and sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Transfer batter to pan; spread evenly.
Bake cake until pale golden and tester inserted into center comes out with some crumbs attached, 29 to 32 minutes. Cool cake completely in pan on rack. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover pan tightly and store cake at room temperature.
Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream and 2 tablespoons cream of coconut in large bowl until peaks form. Spread whipped cream over top of cake. Drizzle 2 tablespoons cream of coconut over whipped cream. Using table knife, swirl cream of coconut throughout whipped cream. Sprinkle toasted coconut over.
Cut cake into squares; transfer to plates. Drizzle hibiscus sauce around cake.

Rosemary Cookies with Tomato Jam
2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour
1/4 cup (40 g) stone-ground yellow cornmeal or polenta
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup (8 ounces/225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
10 tablespoons (135 g) sugar
2 large egg yolks
1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
Tomato Jam

In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, and salt.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a bowl by hand), beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed just until smooth. Mix in the egg yolks, then the rosemary. Add the flour mixture and mix until the dough is smooth and holds together.
On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a log about 6 inches (15 cm) long and 1 3/4 inches (4 cm) in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 1 hour.
Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Slice the logs into disks 1/4 inch (6 mm) inch thick and place the disks about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake, rotating the baking sheets midway through baking, until the edges of the cookies are lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely.
Spread a scant 1 1/2 teaspoons of the jam on the underside of half of the cookies. Top the jam with a second cookie, bottom side down, to make sandwiches.
The dough can be frozen for up to 1 month. Once filled, the cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Gluten-Free Coconut Layer Cake
3 cups heavy cream, chilled
9 ounces white chocolate, coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons coconut or golden rum
1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 3/4 cup almond flour
2 tablespoons coconut flour
10 large eggs, at room temperature, separated
1 tablespoon coconut or golden rum
2 cups confectioner's sugar, sifted
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
2 cups (3 ounces) unsweetened coconut flakes, for coating
Special equipment: 3 (9-inch) round cake pans

Chill bowl of stand mixer and whisk attachment or large metal bowl and beaters for at least 15 minutes.
In small saucepan over moderate heat, bring 1 cup cream to simmer. Transfer white chocolate to medium heatproof bowl, pour hot cream over, and whisk until smooth. Whisk in rum and salt. Let cool at room temperature until thickened slightly, about 1 hour.
In chilled bowl of electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat remaining 2 cups cream at moderately high speed until whisk leaves marks but cream does not quite hold soft peaks, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn mixer off, then add white chocolate mixture and beat just until stiff peaks begin to form, about 5 minutes. (Do not overbeat, or cream will curdle.) Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours. (Frosting can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 8 hours.)
Preheat oven to 350F. Line bottoms of cake pans with parchment paper.
In large bowl, whisk together almond and coconut flours.
In bowl of electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg yolks at high speed until pale yellow and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce speed to moderately low and beat in rum and all but 1 tablespoon confectioner's sugar. Scrape down bowl, then increase speed to high and beat until pale and thick, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and gradually add almond and coconut flour mixture, scraping down bowl and folding in last of flour by hand. Set aside.
In clean dry bowl of electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites on moderate speed until very foamy, about 1 minute. Beat in cream of tartar, salt, and remaining 1 tablespoon confectioner's sugar. Increase speed to moderately high and beat until whites hold stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Fold 1 cup beaten egg whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then gently fold in remaining whites. Divide batter between pans, smoothing tops, and bake until layers are golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Invert pans onto wire racks and cool completely, at least 1 hour. Run knife around cake layers to loosen, invert onto rack, and peel off the parchment.
Layer cake, using 1 cup frosting between each layer, then frost top and sides with remaining frosting. Press coconut flakes onto the frosting. Refrigerate until frosting is firm, at least 3 hours or overnight.

Carrot Cake with Lime and Mascarpone Topping
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 level teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, preferably freshly ground
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 cup light muscovado or light brown sugar
2/3 cup (scant) sunflower oil
2 organic large eggs
2 1/2 cups coarsely grated organic carrots
3/4 cup shelled walnuts, roughly chopped
1 lime
1 cup (scant) mascarpone
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup unrefined confectioners' sugar
juice of 1/2 lemon, or to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line two 8 inch cake pans (or one deep pan). Sift the flour and baking powder together into a large bowl and mix in the spices.
Using an electric mixer, whisk together the muscovado (or brown) sugar, sunflower oil, and eggs until smooth. With a large metal spoon, fold in the grated carrots and chopped walnuts, then fold in the flour and spices until evenly combined.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake pan(s), set on a baking tray, and bake until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean; test after 25 minutes for layer cake; 40 minutes for a deep cake. Leave to cool in the pan(s) on a wire rack.
For the frosting, pare a few shreds of lime zest with a zester and set aside; grate the rest of the zest and squeeze the juice from one half. In a bowl, beat the mascarpone with the softened butter, sugar, grated lime zest, and the lime and lemon juices. Taste. I like a good sharp topping, so sometimes add more lime, sometimes more lemon juice.
Sandwich the layers together with some of the mascarpone mixture, (or cut a deep cake into two layers). Spread the frosting over the top of the cake and smooth it down the sides to cover completely, then ruffle the surface. Either refrigerate or serve immediately, topped with the reserved zest. I like it a little cold, so that the frosting has set slightly.
Add snowdrops in season!

Espresso Cheesecake
2 cups chocolate wafer cookies or Oreos, processed until very fine
1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
1 1/4 pounds cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup fresh espresso grounds (don't use soggy, used grounds. Grind fresh beans into a fine powder and add this directly to the batter.)
3 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk
1 cup brewed coffee
1 tablespoon instant espresso added to the coffee
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place the cookies in a small bowl, drizzle the butter over them, and stir, making sure the crumbs are evenly coated with butter.
Place the cookie crumbs in an ungreased 9-inch spring-form pan. With your hands, pat and spread the crumbs evenly over the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of the pan. Bake in the center of the oven for 5 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool to room temperature.
Lower the oven temperature to 200 degrees F.
Place the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and, with the whisk attachment, beat on high until smooth. Add the espresso grounds and mix until incorporated.
Add the eggs one at a time, beating until each is completely incorporated. Add the egg yolk.
Add the coffee mixture, vanilla, and flour. Mix until smooth and all ingredients are well incorporated.
Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake in the center of the oven for a few hours&151;;at least two hours, and maybe as long as four hours.
You can check for doneness by giving the pan a little shake. If it wobbles like it's still very liquid in the center, keep going. This could take hours. But I'm betting you want a cheesecake with a creamy-smooth consistency and no cracks. So just wait. If you give the cheesecake a shimmy and it jiggles just a little in the middle but otherwise seems nice and firm, turn off the oven but leave the cheesecake inside to cool slowly. Then remove the cheesecake from the oven and set aside to cool completely in the pan.
Unmold the cheesecake and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 3 hours before serving.

Christmas Coconut Cake
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature
2 cups sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk (available canned in the Asian section of most grocery stores, or see Tip)
1/4 cup coconut cream (Coco Lopez)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 large egg whites at room temperature
1 cup cold heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons coconut cream (Coco Lopez)
1/2 cup grated fresh coconut (optional, see Tip)
2 large egg whites
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/3 cup cold water
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup mini marshmallows
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 to 4 cups unsweetened flaked coconut for decorating

Place an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and another in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter three 9-inch cake pans, then line each with a parchment paper round. Butter the paper and dust the pans with flour; knock out the excess.
Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt to blend. In a small bowl, stir together the milk, coconut milk, and coconut cream until smooth. Add the flour mixture in 3 increments, alternating with the milk mixture in 2 increments, starting and ending with the flour mixture. After each addition, mix at low speed just to combine the ingredients. Stir in the vanilla.
Place an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and another in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter three 9-inch cake pans, then line each with a parchment paper round. Butter the paper and dust the pans with flour; knock out the excess.
Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream on high speed until soft peaks form. Beat in the coconut cream and the fresh coconut, if using.
Whisk the egg whites, sugar, water, cream of tartar, and salt in a large stainless-steel bowl until thoroughly combined. Place the bowl over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of barely simmering water. Using a hand beater or handheld electric mixer, continue beating the egg white mixture for 4 minutes. Add the mini marshmallows in 2 increments while continuing to beat. Wait until the first batch of marshmallows has melted before adding the second. Continue beating for 2 to 3 minutes more, until stiff peaks form. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and continue beating until the frosting is thick enough to spread.
Stack one cake layer on a serving plate and spread the top with half of the whipped cream filling. Repeat with a second layer. Stack the final cake layer on top of the first two and cover the cake's top and sides with the frosting. Sprinkle the coconut on the top and sides of the cake.
Cover the cake loosely with plastic wrap and store for 1 day at room temperature or up to 3 days in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.
It's challenging to press coconut into the sides of the cake. When pressing the coconut in, the icing invariably sticks to my fingers and mars the frosting's finish. I've discovered that throwing small handfuls of coconut toward the side of the cake makes it adhere quite wellâa messy but effective technique for creating a gorgeous-looking cake.
For those who want to follow Aunt Molly's original recipe, here are her directions for extracting coconut meat and liquid from a fresh coconut:  inchFirst buy a fresh coconut. To select the best one, shake it to listen for a lot of milk inside. Prepare the coconut by first making a hole or two in one end with a hammer and ice pick. Stand the coconut up over a small bowl or glass measuring cup to catch the milk as it drains out. Next, crack the hard outer shell with a hammer, then pry off the pieces. The inner white coconut meat can then be grated [with a handheld microplane grater]. Refrigerate both the milk and grated coconut until ready to use. inch

Apple-Spice Layer Cake with Caramel Swirl Icing
1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature
3 cups sugar
2 tablespoons light molasses
6 large eggs
3 cups cake flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup sour cream
3 Granny Smith apples, peeled and shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (optional)
One 14-ounce bag caramels
4 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups powdered sugar
1 cup (8 ounces) mascarpone (Italian cream cheese, available at most grocery stores)
2 cups pecan pieces, toasted (optional)

Place one oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and a second rack in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 9-inch cake pans with butter or cooking spray, then line each with a parchment paper round and grease the rounds. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat in the molasses. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating between each addition. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, salt, and ground spices to blend. Add the flour mixture and sour cream alternately to the batter. (Start and end with the flour mixture, adding the flour mixture in 3 increments and the sour cream in 2 increments.) After each addition, mix on low speed just to combine the ingredients. Stir in the shredded apples, vanilla, and ginger.
Spoon the batter (it will be thick) evenly into the prepared pans. Place two cake pans side by side on one rack and the third on the other. Stagger the cake layers on the oven racks so that no layer is directly over another. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until firm to the touch. Monitor the layers carefully for doneness; each one may be done at a different time. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the pans and unmold the cakes onto wire racks to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes, before frosting. The cakes can be kept frozen, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 3 weeks. Defrost them at room temperature before unwrapping. Frost immediately.
To make the icing: In a medium stainless-steel bowl, combine the unwrapped caramels, 2 tablespoons of the cream, and the 2 tablespoons butter. Place over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of simmering water. Stir the caramel mixture until smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat. Let cool, stirring the mixture every few minutes until cool to the touch, about 20 minutes. (If the mixture is too warm, it will melt the buttercream frosting when it is stirred in later.)
While the caramel is cooling, make the butter cream: Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the 1 1/2 cups butter on medium-high speed for about 1 minute, until pale in color. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream and the vanilla and powdered sugar, and beat for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the mascarpone and beat on medium-low speed until incorporated. Do not overbeat the mascarpone, or it may separate. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooled caramel mixture to drizzle over the cake once it is frosted. Stir the remainder of the caramel into the frosting, using large strokes to create caramel swirls throughout. Don't stir it too much or the ribbons of caramel will disappear.
Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a thick blanket of frosting on top. Add the second layer and spread thickly with frosting. Add the third layer and cover the top and sides of the cake with an even layer of frosting. Use a small spoon to drizzle the reserved 1/4 cup of caramel over the top of the cake. Pat on the toasted pecan pieces to cover the sides of the cake. Tip: Using the proper tools for cutting frosted layer cakes ensures that individual servings look as good as they taste. I use a large serrated knife dipped in hot water for cutting. I wipe the knife off with a clean dishcloth after each piece, which ensures that every cut is as clean as the first.

Huguenot Torte
2 Gala apples
7 ounces (1 cup + 5 tablespoons) all-purpose flour, divided
4 ounces (1 cup) walnuts

13 ounces (1 3/4 cups) superfine granulated sugar, divided
2 ounces (1/2 cup) confectioners' sugar, sifted, plus more for dusting
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and place the rack in the middle position. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.
2. Peel, core, and chop the apples into 1/4-inch cubes. In a large bowl, toss them with 3 tablespoons of the flour to activate the glutens. Use a spoon or flexible spatula, rather than your hands.
3. Grind the nuts, 2 ounces of the superfine sugar, and the confectioners' sugar in a food processor with the steel blade for 20 to 30 seconds. In a bowl, mix together the nuts, the remaining flour, and the salt. Whisk to combine.
4. Combine the eggs and the remaining superfine sugar in a standing mixer fitted with the wire whip attachment and whip at medium speed until stiff, about 4 minutes.
5. Reduce the speed to low and slowly add the nut-and-flour mixture to the eggs.
6. Fold in the apples using a flexible spatula.
7. Distribute the batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
8. Cool the cake to room temperature, dust the top with confectioners' sugar, and cut slices directly from the baking dish.

Mint-Glazed Butter Thins
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon pure peppermint extract, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
11/4 cups all purpose flour
2 cups powdered sugar, divided
2 tablespoons (or more) heavy whipping cream

Position racks in top and bottom third of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Using electric mixer, beat first 4 ingredients, 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract, and salt in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in flour.
Place 1 cup powdered sugar in bowl. Working with 1 level tablespoon at a time, shape dough into balls; roll in powdered sugar to coat. Place on sheet. Press each lightly with flat-bottomed cup. Sprinkle each with more powdered sugar, then press again to thin 3 1/4-inch round. Bake cookies 8 minutes. Reverse sheets; bake until golden at edges, about 9 minutes longer.
Meanwhile, stir 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract, and 2 tablespoons cream in small bowl until smooth, adding more cream by 1/2 teaspoonfuls if glaze is too thick to spread.
Transfer cookies to rack; spread glaze over warm cookies. Cool on rack.

Starry Starry Nights
2 large eggs
2.4 ounces ( 1/4 cup plus one tablespoon) sugar, plus additional for dipping
1 tablespoon honey
8.2 ounces bittersweet chocolate (I use 2 whole bars plus 2 strips of bittersweet Lindt chocolate which comes in a 3.5 ounce bar and is available at most grocery stores)
3 tablespoons butter
2.6 ounces slivered almonds (about 5/8 cup sliver almonds measured before grinding) ground to a fine powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons non-dutch processed cocoa powder

Combine the eggs, sugar, and honey in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat with the whisk attachment on high speed until the mixture reaches a thick ribbon stage.
Melt the chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Cool slightly.
Toss the almond flour, salt, and cocoa in a bowl until well combined. Add to the melted chocolate and mix until fully incorporated.
Add a quarter of the whipped egg mixture to the chocolate to lighten. Stir until no egg is visible. Gently fold the rest of the egg mixture into the chocolate until well combined, being careful to maintain the aerated quality of the eggs.
Chill until firm.
Place a few tablespoons of sugar in a small bowl. Using the smallest cookie scooper available (I use one the size of a melon baller), scoop individual cookies, dip them in the sugar, and place on a parchment-lined sheet pan 1/2 inch apart. Freeze uncovered until very hard, about an hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Just before baking, dip each cookie in sugar again. Bake 10 minutes, turning after 5 minutes to ensure even baking. Cookies should be slightly cracked but the sugar should not be browned.

Spice Cake with Caramelized Pears and Maple Buttercream
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
5 large eggs
2 1/4 pounds Bartlett or Bosc pears (about 5)
1/2 stick unsalted butter
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons brandy
4 large egg whites at room temperature 30 minutes
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup maple sugar
1 1/3 cups pure maple syrup (preferably Grade A dark amber)
4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons and softened
Equipment: 3 (8-inch) round cake pans (2 inches deep; see cooks' note, below); a candy thermometer

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in middle. Butter and flour cake pans.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and spices in a large bowl. Stir together milk and vanilla in a small bowl.
Beat butter and sugars with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, mix in flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk mixture (begin and end with flour mixture) and mixing until just combined.
Divide batter among pans, smoothing tops, then rap pans once or twice on counter to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake until pale golden and a wooden pick inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pans on racks 10 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge of pans, then invert cakes onto racks. Reinvert and cool completely.
Peel and core pears, then coarsely chop.
Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until foam subsides, then sautÃ© pears, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sugar, lemon juice, and brandy and cook over high heat, stirring, until juices are deep golden and pears are tender, about 5 minutes.
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar and salt using cleaned beaters at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Add maple sugar a little at a time, beating, then continue to beat until whites just hold stiff peaks.
Boil maple syrup in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, undisturbed, until it reaches soft-ball stage (238 to 242 degrees F on candy thermometer), 3 to 7 minutes.
With mixer at low speed, immediately pour hot syrup in a slow stream down side of bowl into egg whites, then beat at high speed, scraping down side of bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula, until meringue is cool to the touch, about 6 minutes. (It's important that meringue be fully cooled before proceeding.)
At medium speed, add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. (If buttercream looks soupy after some butter is added, meringue is too warm: Chill bottom of bowl in an ice bath for a few seconds before continuing to beat in remaining butter.) Continue beating until buttercream is smooth. (Mixture may look curdled before all butter is added but will come together before beating is finished.)
Put 1 cake layer on a serving plate, then spread with 3/4 cup buttercream and top with half of pear filling. Top with second cake layer, 3/4 cup buttercream, and remaining pear filling. Top with remaining cake layer, then frost top and sides of cake with remaining buttercream.

Amy Sedaris's Vanilla Cupcakes
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups flour
1 1/4 cups milk
Amy Sedaris's Vanilla Buttercream Frostingepi:recipelink</epi:recipelink>

Turn oven on to 375 degrees F.
Put butter in mixer and beat at medium speed until somewhat smooth. Pour in sugar and beat well. Add 2 eggs. I like to crack the eggs on the side of the bowl while it is moving, which can be really stupid. I like to take chances. Yes, I have had to throw away my batter because I lost eggshells in the mix. Yes, it was a waste of food and yes, I know how expensive butter is, but what can I say? I'm a daredevil. Mix well. Add: vanilla, baking powder, salt, flour, and milk. Beat until it looks like it is supposed to and pour into individual baking cups, until they are about 2/3 full. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Should produce 24 cupcakes; I get 18 because I'm doing something wrong, although my cupcakes were voted second best in the city by New York Magazine.

Let stand until chocolate softens, about 3 minutes. Using small offset spatula, spread bittersweet chocolate over top of cookie in thin even layer. Immediately sprinkle chopped peppermint candies over.
Stir white chocolate in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove from over water. Using fork, drizzle white chocolate all over cookies. Chill until white chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.
Using paper overhang as aid, lift cookie from pan and transfer to work surface. Using large knife, cut cookie into irregular pieces. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store in refrigerator in airtight containers between layers of waxed paper or parchment paper.
For a variation on this cookie, sprinkle the melted dark chocolate with chopped peanut brittle or peanut butter cups instead of the peppermint candies.

Chocolate and Zucchini Cake
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature, or 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 pat butter or teaspoon olive oil for greasing
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
3 large eggs
2 cups unpeeled grated zucchini, from about 1 1/2 medium zucchini (keep the remaining 1/2 zucchini for optional garnish)
1 cup good-quality bittersweet chocolate chips
Confectioners' sugar or melted bittersweet chocolate (optional)

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 10-inch springform pan with butter or oil.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In a food processor, process the sugar and butter until creamy (you can also do this by hand, armed with a sturdy spatula). Add the vanilla, coffee granules, and eggs, mixing well between each addition.
3. Reserve a cup of the flour mixture and add the rest to the egg mixture. Mix until just combined; the batter will be thick.
4. Add the zucchini and chocolate chips to the reserved flour mixture and toss to coat. Fold into the batter and blend with a wooden spoonâdon't overmix. Pour into the prepared cake pan and level the surface with a spatula.
5. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Transfer to a rack to cool for 10 minutes, run a knife around the pan to loosen the cake, and unclasp the sides of the pan. Let cool to room temperature before serving.
Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, glaze with melted chocolate, or decorate with a few slices of raw zucchini (you don't have to eat them, though).

Orange Upside-Down Cake
1 large thin-skinned orange, such as Valencia
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons skim milk
1/3 cup sugar
1/2-ounce package active dry yeast
2 large eggs, separated, plus 2 additional large egg whites
2 tablespoons trans-free margarine
2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2/3 cup stone-ground yellow cornmeal

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Wash the orange. Cut off and discard the ends. Cut the orange crosswise into slices about 1/4 inch thick. Remove any seeds. Put in the skillet, add 1/4 cup water,and sprinkle with sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, gently stirring to keep the fruit from sticking. Cook until the liquid is almost gone and the orange slices are caramelized. With a fork, move the orange slices into an attractive pattern in the bottom of the skillet.
3. In a small saucepan, heat the milk until warm but not hot. Remove from heat and add 1 teaspoon of the sugar and the yeast. Stir until the yeast is dissolved.
Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, beat together the 2 egg yolks, the remaining sugar, and the margarine until pale yellow and thick. Add the orange zest and vanilla; mix well. Sift the cornmeal into the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Stir in the yeast mixture,which should now be frothy.
5. In a clean bowl, beat all 4 egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Stir a third of the beaten whites into the cornmeal mixture. Carefully fold in the remaining whites. Spoon the batter in dollops over the orange slices in the skillet. Smooth the top.
6. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean. Run a knife between the sides of the skillet and the cake. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Hold a flat serving plate over the skillet and invert the cake. Serve while still warm.

Limoncello TiramisÃ¹
5 large eggs
5 or 6 lemons
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups limoncello liqueur
1 cup water
1 pound (2 cups) mascarpone, at room temperature
40 ladyfingers (preferably imported Italian savoiardi), or more as needed

Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan. Separate the eggs, putting yolks into the large bowl of the double boiler and the whites into another stainless-steel bowl for whipping by hand or with an electric mixer.
Remove the zest of two or more of the lemons, using a fine grater, to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.
To make the base for the tiramisÃ¹, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and Â± cup of the limoncello until well blended.
Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface, take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.
Meanwhile, pour the remaining cup of limoncello, all of the lemon juice, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.
In another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks. When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.
Pour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie brieflyâif it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.
Scoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream. Smooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramisÃ¹ airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramisÃ¹ in any size you like, and lift each out of the pan onto dessert plates.

Spiced Brown Butter and Walnut Tuille Cups
7 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 large egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
Pinch of Chinese five-spice powder*
Pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup minus 1 tablespoon all purpose flour
1/4 cup (about) finely chopped walnuts
4 3/4-cup custard cups
Small offset spatula
Wide metal spatula

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick silicone baking mats. Arrange four 3/4-cup custard cups upside down on work surface.
Stir butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until nutty brown and milk solids are dark brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Carefully pour browned butter into small bowl and cool slightly.
Combine egg whites, sugar, five-spice powder, and salt in medium bowl; whisk until mixture is foamy, about 1 minute. Add warm browned butter, leaving dark brown milk solids behind in bowl; whisk until blended. Whisk in vanilla. Add flour and whisk until blended and smooth.
Drop batter by scant tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 4 inches apart (about 4 per sheet). Using small offset spatula, spread each to 5-inch round (batter will be spread very thin). Sprinkle generous 1/4 teaspoon finely chopped walnuts over each.
Bake tuiles, 1 sheet at a time, until evenly golden all over, about 11 minutes. Working quickly and using wide metal spatula, carefully lift each tuile from sheet and immediately drape over custard cup and press to mold to cup, making cookie bowls. Cool until tuiles are set. Carefully remove tuiles from cups and place on rack to cool completely. Repeat procedure with batter and walnuts on cool baking sheets, making total of 12 cookie bowls (to allow for any breakage). For additional cookies, if desired, drop remaining batter onto baking sheets by teaspoonfuls, spacing 2 inches apart, and bake until evenly golden. Transfer to rack and cool. DO AHEAD: Cookie bowls and cookies can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
*A spice blend that usually contains ground fennel seeds, Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon, star anise, and cloves; available in the spice section of most supermarkets.

Korova Cookies
1 1/4 cups (175 grams) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (30 grams) Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 stick plus 3 tablespoons (5 1/2 ounces; 150 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2/3 cup (120 grams) packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar
1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
5 ounces (150 grams) bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small bits

1. Sift the flour, cocoa, and baking soda together and keep close at hand. Put the butter in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until the butter is soft and creamy. (Alternatively, you can do this and all subsequent steps by hand, working with a sturdy rubber spatula.) Add both sugars, the salt, and vanilla extract and beat for another minute or two. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the sifted dry ingredients. Mix only until the dry ingredients are incorporatedâthe dough will look crumbly, and that's just right. For the best texture, you want to work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.
2. Turn the dough out onto a smooth work surface and squeeze it so that it sticks together in large clumps. Gather the dough into a ball, divide it in half, and working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) in diameter. (Cookie-dough logs have a way of ending up with hollow centers, so as you're shaping each log, flatten it once or twice and roll it up from one long side to the other, just to make certain you haven't got an air channel.) Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and chill them for at least 2 hours. (Wrapped airtight, the logs can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for 1 month.)
3. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and keep them close at hand.
4. Working with a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) thick. (Don't be upset if the rounds break; just squeeze the broken-off bit back onto the cookie.) Place the cookies on the parchment-lined sheets, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) spread space between them.
5. Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time, and bake each sheet for 12 minutes. The cookies will not look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies stand until they are only just warm or until they reach room temperatureâit's your call. Repeat with the second sheet of cookies.

Cardamom-Orange Sugar Cookies
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated orange peel
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg, room temperature
Raw sugar

Whisk flour, cardamom, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar; beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in finely grated orange peel and vanilla. Add egg; beat to blend. Add 1/3 of flour mixture; beat on low speed just to blend. Add remaining flour in 2 additions, beating on low speed just until blended. Refrigerate until firm enough to shape, about 1 hour.
Divide dough in half. Form each half into ball. Flatten into disks and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm enough to roll out, about 45 minutes. DO AHEAD: Dough can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let chilled dough stand at room temperature until soft enough to roll out, about 15 minutes.
Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to generous 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out cookies using festive cookie cutters. Carefully transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with raw sugar. Gather dough scraps into ball. Flatten, cover, and freeze dough until firm enough to roll out again, about 10 minutes.
Bake cookies until light golden brown, about 16 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through baking for even cooking. Carefully slide parchment paper with cookies onto racks to cool completely. Let baking sheets cool completely, then repeat process with remaining dough, lining sheets with fresh parchment between batches. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 3 days ahead. Store cookies in airtight containers at room temperature.
Also called turbinado or demerara sugar; available at most supermarkets and at natural foods stores.

Triple-Ginger Cookies
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/3 cup minced crystallized ginger
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, crystallized ginger, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until creamy and light, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in both brown sugars. Beat on medium-high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg, molasses, fresh ginger, ground ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Beat to blend. Add flour mixture in 2 additions, beating on low speed just to blend between additions.
Place 1/3 cup sugar in small bowl. Measure 1 tablespoon dough. Roll into ball between palms of hands, then roll in sugar in bowl to coat; place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cookie dough, spacing cookies 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart.
Bake cookies until surfaces crack and cookies are firm around edges but still slightly soft in center, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on sheets on rack. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made up to 4 days ahead. Store in airtight containers at room temperature.

Lemon or Orange Cake (Cake Citron ou Cake Orange)
2 1/4 cups (250 grams) cake flour, sifted
3/4 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups (335 grams) sugar
Grated zest of 3 lemons or 2 oranges
5 large eggs, at room temperature
2/3 cup (165 grams) crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, homemade or storebought, or heavy cream, at room temperature
2 tablespoons (30 grams) dark rum (for the lemon cake) or Grand Marnier (for the orange cake)
7 1/2 tablespoons (3 3/4 ounces; 110 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Butter and flour a 9 x 5 x 3-inch (22.5 x 12.5 x 7.5-cm) loaf pan, dust the interior with flour, and tap out the excess. Put the pan on an insulated baking sheet or on two stacked regular baking sheets and set aside.
2. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together and keep close at hand. Toss the sugar and zest together in a large bowl and rub them together with your fingertips until the sugar is moist and aromatic. Whisk in the eggs, beating until the mixture is pale and foamy, then whisk in the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and rum. Switch to a large rubber spatula and gently stir the sifted flour mixture into the batter in three or four additionsâthe batter should be thick and smooth. Finally, fold in the cooled melted butter in two or three additions.
3. Immediately spoon the batter into the pan and slide the baking sheet(s) into the oven. Bake for 1 hour and 25 to 30 minutes, or until a thin knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out dry and free of crumbs. (Check the cake at the 40-minute mark. If it is browning quickly, cover it loosely with a foil tent for the remainder of the baking period.) Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes on a cooling rack before turning it out of the pan; invert and cool to room temperature right side up.

1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
4 large eggs, warmed in very warm water 10 minutes
3 large egg whites
1 1/2 cups sugar
6 tablespoons water
1 1/2 tablespoons instant espresso powder (optional; see cooks' note, below)
Equipment: 3 (9- by 2-inch) round cake pans; a pastry bag with writing tip (slightly less than 1/8 inch); a handheld electric mixer

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Butter cake pans, then line bottoms with rounds of parchment paper. Dust pans with flour, knocking out excess.
Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
Whisk together boiling-hot water and cocoa in another bowl until smooth, then whisk in milk and vanilla.
Beat butter and sugars with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, mix in flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with cocoa mixture, beginning and ending with flour, and mixing until just combined.
Divide batter among pans, smoothing tops. Bake, switching position of pans halfway through, until a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean and cakes begin to pull away from sides of pans, 20 to 25 minutes.
Cool cakes in pans on racks 20 minutes, then turn out onto racks to cool completely.
Trace a 9-inch circle on a sheet of parchment paper, then draw a spiderweb inside circle. Next to web, draw a 2-to 3-inch spider. Turn drawings over onto a baking sheet.
Melt chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring. Cool slightly, then transfer to pastry bag. Pipe chocolate onto web, beginning with spokes, and onto spider on parchment, then freeze until firm, about 1 hour.
Put frosting ingredients in a heatproof large bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Beat with handheld mixer at low speed until mixture is warm and sugar has dissolved.

Glowing Jack-o'-Lantern Cookies
1/3 cup hard candies
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon lemon zest, optional
1 teaspoon lemon juice
red and yellow liquid coloring or orange paste coloring
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment, foil, or a Silpat mat (not wax paper, which will stick).
2. Unwrap the candies if wrapped, put them in a heavy ziplock bag, and crush them into powder with the flat side of a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a saucepan.
Beat the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl until creamy, and then blend in the egg, lemon zest, if using, lemon juice, and food coloring. Begin with 6 drops of red and 5 drops of yellow liquid coloring or a dab of orange paste; add more to achieve your desired shade. Stir well until fully combined.
4. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt to the bowl, and mix well.
5. Roll half of the dough out on a lightly floured surface and cut out 8 big jack-o'-lantern shapes with a cookie cutter, or freehand with the tip of a paring knife. Make short, fat pumpkins about 4 inches wide by 3 inches high, or make tall, thin pumpkins about 4 inches tall and 2 to 3 inches wide. You want some variety here! Use the knife to cut out big eyes, nose, and mouth in each (don't do a lot of teeth - they tend to break off). Keep in mind that you want the eyes, nose, and mouth to be wide enough to hold the melted candy. Carefully lift the pumpkins with a spatula and transfer them to the prepared baking sheets. Use the tip of the paring knife to push back the eye, nose, and mouth openings to make them as wide as possible without losing the bridges of dough between the features. Repeat with the remaining dough half.
6. With the tip of a small spoon, sprinkle candy powder generously into the eyes, nose, and mouth openings, directly to the parchment. Try to keep the candy off the surface of the cookies.
7. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, watching carefully. Remove as soon as the candy has melted; don't let the surface of the cookies brown. They should be just set and very pale.
8. Cool the cookies on the baking sheets, or carefully lift the parchment off the sheets and transfer the whole sheet to cooling racks (only if the racks are big enough to hold the sheet). When the cookies are completely cool, carefully peel off the parchment.

Phoenician Honey Cookies (Biscuits)
butter, for greasing
1 3/4 cups (200 g / 7 oz) all-purpose (plain) flour
pinch of salt
2 tablespoons superfine (caster) sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 tablespoon grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons ammonium bicarbonate or baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)
equal quantities olive and corn oil, for deep-frying
finely chopped walnuts, for sprinkling
1 1/4 cups (250 g / 9 oz) superfine (caster) sugar
1/2 cup (120 ml / 4 fl oz) honey

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C/Gas Mark 6) and grease 2 cookie sheets (baking trays) with butter. Sift together the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add the sugar, oil, lemon zest, and vanilla. Stir the baking soda into 5 tablespoons water in a bowl and pour into the well.

Upside-Down Pear Chocolate Cake
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, for pan
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar
1/4 cup water
3 firm but ripe pears, peeled, cored, and each cut into 12 slices (1 pound prepped)
1/4 cup (2 ounces) unsalted butter
4 ounces dark chocolate, chopped
1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (1 ounce) unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup whole milk
Chantilly cream or Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, for serving (optional)

Butter a 9-inch round baking pan.
To make the fruit topping, put the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan (one with a tight-fitting lid) and stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then cover and cook for 2 minutes. (Covering in this way allows the steam to wash down the sides of pan, which will prevent any sugar crystals from forming.) Uncover the saucepan and continue to boil the sugar, gently and slowly swirling the pan as needed to cook the caramel evenly, until it becomes a dark amber color. Occasionally wash down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Carefully pour the caramel into the prepared pan and allow it to harden. The pan will be very hot from the sugar, so take care in moving it if you need to. Fan the pear slices on top of the caramel in a circle around the perimeter, filling in the center with the remaining slices.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
To make the cake, place the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat and melt, stirring occasionally. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Transfer the melted chocolate to a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and add the sugar. Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture in three additions alternating with the milk in two additions, beginning and ending with the flour and scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the middle of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the cake bounces back slightly when touched. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then invert the cake onto a plate, leaving the pan on top of the cake for 5 minutes before you remove it. Serve the cake warm, topped with a small dollop of Chantilly cream or a scoop of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.
Storage: Wrapped in plastic wrap, the cake will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Butter for coating cake pans, at room temperature
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting the pan
2 cups granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3 large eggs, beaten
1 cup canola or vegetable oil
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups canned unsweetened pumpkin purÃ©e
1 cup lightly packed sweetened flaked coconut
3/4 cup canned crushed pineapple (do not drain)
1/3 cup dried currants
2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, at room temperature
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 tablespoons canned unsweetened pumpkin purÃ©e
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch sides. Line the bottom of each pan with a circle of parchment paper. Butter the parchment paper. Sprinkle the pans with flour, tap the pans to evenly distribute the flour, and then shake off the excess flour. Set aside.
To make the cake, in a large bowl, sift together the 2 cups flour, the granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, oil, and vanilla. In another medium bowl, combine the pumpkin purÃ©e, coconut, crushed pineapple, and currants.
Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Add the pumpkin mixture and stir just until combined. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, spreading it evenly. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. Transfer to wire racks and let cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cakes. Invert the cakes onto the racks and peel off the parchment paper. Let cool completely before frosting the cakes.
To make the frosting, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed for about 3 minutes until smooth. Add the butter and beat for about 2 minutes until combined. Add the pumpkin purÃ©e and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla and beat for about 3 minutes until fluffy.
Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or platter. Using an offset spatula, spread half of the frosting over the top of the first cake layer. Spread the frosting right to the edge of the top without frosting the sides of the cake. Carefully place the second cake on top, lining up the edges. Spread the remaining frosting over the top of the cake without frosting the sides. Swirl the frosting to decorate the top. Refrigerate the cake to set the frosting. Remove from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before serving.

1/2 cup organic whole wheat pastry flour
1 1/2 cups organic cane sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 1/4 teaspoons organic ground cinnamon
Pinch of freshly grated organic nutmeg

3 organic eggs
Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting
3/4 cup chopped toasted organic walnuts
1/2 cup organic golden raisins, plumped in warm water for 20 minutes and drained
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh organic ginger

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper (to ensure that the cake will not stick), or place liners in 2 muffin pans for 24 cupcakes. Set aside.
Place the dried coconut in a cup of warm water to soften and set it aside for 15 minutes.
Place the carrots in a food processor and pulse on and off for 1 minute. Then add the pineapple and pulse until the carrots are cut into very small pieces and the pineapple is pureed, 1 to 2 minutes.
In a large bowl, sift together the dry ingredients. Add the brown sugar and use a whisk to break up any lumps.
Drain the coconut and place it in a medium bowl. Add the oil, vanilla extract, eggs, and carrot-pineapple mixture, and whisk to combine.
Add the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing with a rubber spatula to incorporate but not overmix. When the batter is almost mixed, stir in the additions, if using. Pour the batter into the prepared pans.
Bake for 55 minutes, or until the tops are a very golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. (It may look as if the cake is too well done, but it takes a while to bake because it's so dense.) For cupcakes, the baking time is 35 to 40 minutes.
Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then invert them onto a wire rack and let them cool completely.
Fill and frost the cake with the Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting (for added oomph, add 1/2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger to the frosting).
Fill and frost the cake with cream cheese frosting and let chill. Tint 1/2 cup frosting lemon yellow, and use the 10 tip to pipe 5 dots in a circle to create simple buttercup flowers. Then combine any remaining yellow frosting with some additional cream cheese frosting and tint it leaf green. I use tip #67, which pipes small fern stems. Pipe the center stamen with cream cheese frosting and chill to set.

Sachertorte
4 1/2 ounces high-quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
9 tablespoons (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature
1 cup confectioners' sugar
6 large eggs, separated, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour (spoon gently into cup and level top)
1 cup Apricot Glaze
Small Batch Chocolate Glaze
Sweetened Whipped Cream , for serving

1. To make the torte: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or wax paper. Dust the sides of the pan with flour and tap out the excess.
2. In the top part of a double boiler over very hot, but not simmering, water, or in a microwave at medium power, melt the chocolate. Remove from the heat or the oven, and let stand, stirring often, until cool.
3. Beat the butter in the bowl of a eavy-duty standing mixer fitted with the paddle blade on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 inute. On low speed, beat in the confectioners' sugar. Return the speed to medium-high and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the chocolate and vanilla.
4. Beat the egg whites and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a handheld electric mixer on high speed just until they form soft, shiny peaks. Do not overbeat. Stir about one fourth of the beaten whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining whites, leaving a few visible wisps of whites. Sift half of the flour over the chocolate mixture, and fold in with a large balloon whisk or rubber spatula. Repeat with the remaining flour.
5. Spread evenly in the pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. (The cake will dome in the center.) Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan, and invert the cake onto the rack. Remove the paper and reinvert on another rack to turn right side up. Cool completely.
6. To assemble: Using a long serrated knife, trim the top of the cake to make it level. Cut the cake horizontally into two equal layers. Place one cake layer on an 8-inch cardboard round. Brush the top of the cake layer with the apricot glaze. Place the second cake layer on top and brush again. Brush the top and sides of the cake with the remaining glaze. Transfer the cake to a wire rack placed over a jelly-roll pan lined with waxed paper. Let cool until the glaze is set.
7. Make the chocolate glaze (it must be freshly made and warm). Pour all of the warm chocolate glaze on top of the cake. Using a metal offset spatula, gently smooth the glaze over the cake, allowing it to run down the sides, being sure that the glaze completely coats the cake (patch any bare spots with the spatula and the icing that has dripped). Cool until the glaze is barely set, then transfer the cake to a serving plate. Refrigerate until the glaze is completely set, at least 1 hour. Remove the cake from the refrigerator about 1 hour before serving.
8. To serve, slice with a sharp knife dipped into hot water. Serve with a large dollop of whipped cream on the side.
The cake can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and stored in an airtight cake container at room temperature.

Pinch of salt
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup cake flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off)
1/4 cup cornstarch
One 9-inch round cake pan or 9-inch springform pan, buttered and bottom lined with buttered parchment or wax paper; a strainer or sifter

1 Set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
2 Half-fill a medium saucepan with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the water is simmering.
3 Whisk the eggs, yolks, salt, and sugar together in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. Place over the pan of simmering water and whisk gently until the mixture is just lukewarm, about 100 degrees (test with your finger). Attach the bowl to the mixer and, with the whisk attachment, whip on medium-high speed until the egg mixture is cooled (touch the outside of the bowl to tell) and tripled in volume. The egg foam will be thick and will form a slowly dissolving ribbon falling back onto the bowl of whipped eggs when the whisk is lifted.
4 While the eggs are whipping, stir together the flour and cornstarch.
5 Sift one-third of the flour mixture over the beaten eggs. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the flour mixture, making sure to scrape all the way to the bottom of the bowl on every pass through the batter to prevent the flour mixture from accumulating there and making lumps. Repeat with another third of the flour mixture and finally with the remainder.
6 Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
7 Bake the gÃªnoise for about 25 minutes, or until well risen, deep gold, and firm to the touch.
8 Immediately use a small pairing knife to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan. Invert the cake onto a rack, then reinvert onto another rack and let the cake cool right side up on the paper. Remove the paper when the cake is cool.
Chocolate Genoise: Reduce the bake flour to 1/3 cup, increase the cornstarch to 1/3 cup, and add 1/4 cup alkalized (Dutch-process) cocoa powder to the flour and cornstarch mixture, sift.
Genoise Sheet: Bake either the plain or chocolate batter in a 10 x 15-inch jelly roll pan that has been buttered and lined with buttered parchment at 400 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. Make sure the cake doesn't overbake and become to dry, especially if it is tot be rolled. (Makes on 10 x 15-inch layer.)

1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
6 cups sifted confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
1/3 cup sifted unsweetened natural cocoa, such as Hershey's regular
5 to 6 tablespoons extra-strength coffee or espresso (or 1 tablespoon instant coffee powder dissolved in 1/2 cup hot water)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pan Preparation: Generously coat the pan(s) with solid shortening, line with baking parchment or wax paper (for a tube or Bundt pan, cut a paper or foil ring), grease the liner, and dust with sifted cocoa; tap out the excess cocoa.
Two 8 by 1 1/2-inch round cake pans or 9- to 9 1/2-inch (6 1/2 to 8-cup) tube or Bundt pan; baking parchment, wax paper, or foil; 1 or 2 foil-covered 8- or 9- or 10-inch cardboard cake disks or flat plates; wooden skewer or cake tester.

Position rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake 30 minutes for layers, 38 to 40 minutes for tube cake. Prepare the pan(s) as directed.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and cocoa. Set aside.
In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar for 3 to 4 minutes, until very well blended. Scrape down the bowl and beater. Beat in the vanilla and eggs and scrape down the bowl and beater again.
With the mixer on the lowest speed, alternately add the flour mixture and the buttermilk. Once the ingredients are blended together, increase the speed and whip for about 30 seconds (no longer, because at high altitudes you don't want to incorporate excess air).
Divide the batter between the two pans or scrape it all into the tube pan. Bake 30 minutes for layers, 38 to 40 minutes for tube cake (or for the time indicated for your altitude in the chart), or until the cake top feels springy to the touch and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan(s) on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes.
Run a knife between the layers and the pan sides to release them, or run the tip of a knife around the pan sides and the top of the tube to loosen the cake. Top each layer, or the tube pan, with a foil-covered cardboard cake disk or flat plate, invert, and give a sharp downward shake to release the cake. Remove the pan and peel off the parchment. Cool completely.
In a food processor or the large bowl of an electric mixer, preferably with the paddle attachment, process or beat the butter until soft. Add 2 cups of the sifted sugar and beat until smooth. Scrape down the bowl and blade or beaters. Add the remaining 4 cups sugar, plus cocoa, 5 tablespoons coffee, and vanilla, and process or beat until completely smooth and creamy. Add more sugar or coffee if necessary to bring the icing to spreading consistency. (The icing can be made a day in advance and refrigerated, covered; bring to room temperature and beat until smooth before using.)
Fill the layers and frost with the buttercream, or dust the tube cake lightly with cocoa or confectioners' sugar (or frost as desired).

Pistachio and Almond Cake with Orange Salad
1 1/3 cups unsalted shelled pistachio nuts
1 1/3 cups blanched whole almonds
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (5 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar
3 lemons
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 eggs
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon  inch00 inch flour or all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3 blood oranges
2 Valencia, navel, or blood oranges
1/4 cup orange marmalade
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
Unsalted shelled pistachio nuts

To make the cake, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Butter a 4-by-8-inch loaf pan. Then, using a sifter or a fine-mesh strainer, dust it with flour, tapping out the excess.
In a food process, combine the pistachios and almonds and pulse until finely ground. Set aside.
Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Grate the zest from the lemons directly into the bowl. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until smooth and creamy. Mix in the vanilla just until incorporated. On low speed, gradually add the nuts and mix just until incorporated. Then add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition just until incorporated. Stir in the flour and salt and mix just until incorporated.
Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Then, run a paring knife around the inside of the pan to loosen the cake sides, invert the cake onto a plate, and lift off the pan. At this point, the cake can be served warm or allowed to cool completely before being sliced and reheated.
To make the orange salad, cut a slice off the top and bottom of 1 orange, stand the orange upright, and cut downward to remove the rind and pith in thick strips. Cut the orange crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, capturing any juice. Repeat with all of the remaining oranges. Set the oranges slices aside until needed.
Gently heat the marmalade in a pot over low heat for about 3 minutes, or until syrupy. Add any captured orange juice along with the lemon juice to the marmalade. Remove the pot from the heat and add 1 to 2 tablespoons water to think the marmalade to the consistency of a vinaigrette. Let cool.
To serve, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the cake into generous slices and place on a baking sheet. Bake the slices, turning them over once, for about 5 minutes, or until warm and slightly toasted on both sides.
Place 4 or 5 orange slices on each plate and drizzle generously with the marmalade syrup. Place the warm pieces of cake next to the orange slices and top with a dollop of yogurt and a few pistachios. Serve immediately.

Rum-Scented Marble Cake
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour (spoon flour into a dry-measure cup and level off)
1 2/3 cups sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 ounces/350 grams (3 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
7 large eggs
3 tablespoons dark rum
2 tablespoons dark rum
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
6 ounces (175 grams) bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate, melted and cooled
2 cups Base Batter
1 (12-cup) tube or Bundt pan, buttered, coated with fine, dry bread crumbs, and sprayed with vegetable oil cooking spray

1. Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir well by hand to mix. Add the butter. Beat the mixture on low speed with the paddle until the mixture is a smooth, heavy paste, 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Whisk the eggs and rum together. On medium speed, beat 1/3 of the egg mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Beat for 1 minute.
4. Stop and scrape down the bowl and beater. Add half of the egg mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Repeat with the other half.
5. Remove the bowl from the mixer and using a large rubber spatula give the batter a final mix.
6. For the chocolate batter, combine the rum, milk, and baking soda in a medium mixing bowl, Whisk well to dissolve the baking soda. Scrape in the chocolate and whisk it well. Add the 2 cups of base batter to the chocolate mixture and whisk well to combine.
7. Scrape half the remaining base batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Cover with the chocolate batter, making it as even a layer as possible. Finally top with the remaining base batter and smooth the top. Use a wide-bladed table knife or a thin metal spatula to marble the batter: Insert the knife into the batter at the central tube, with the flat side of the blade facing you. Draw the blade through the batter to the bottom of the pan and up and out of the side of the pan closest to you, repeating the motion every inch or so around the pan, making a spiral in the batter, almost as though you were folding egg whites into it. Stop when you get back to the point where you started. Don't bother to smooth the top of the batterâit might disturb the marbling.
8. Bake the cake until it is well risen and firm, and a toothpick or a small thin knife inserted midway between the side of the pan and the central tube emerges dry, about 1 hour.
9. Cool the cake in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert a rack over it. Invert and lift off the pan. Cool the cake completely over the rack.

1/2 teaspoon salt
2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 large egg yolks
3 to 4 tablespoons ice water
1 large navel orange
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pistachios (2 1/4 ounces)
About 1 cup confectioners sugar
Equipment: a 3-inch fluted round cookie cutter

Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl (or pulse in a food processor). Blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse) until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Beat together yolks and 3 tablespoon water with a fork and stir into flour (or pulse) until incorporated.
Gently squeeze a small handful of dough: If it doesn't hold together, stir (or pulse) in 1 tablespoon more water. Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 8 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together and divide in half. Form each half into a 4-inch square. Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour.
Cut off peel, including white pith, from orange with a sharp knife and finely chop. (Reserve fruit for another use.) Put peel in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then fill with water. Add salt and bring to a boil, then boil, uncovered, 10 minutes. Drain in a fine-mesh sieve.
Bring granulated sugar and water (3/4 cup) to a boil in saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Add peel to syrup. Gently simmer, uncovered, until peel begins to turn translucent and syrup is reduced to about 2/3 cup, 20 to 30 minutes.
Drain peel in fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, reserving 3 tablespoon syrup. Stir together peel, reserved syrup, and pistachios. Cool to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out 1 piece of dough on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 15- by 12-inch rectangle. Cut out 16 to 20 rounds with cookie cutter.
Put a scant teaspoon filling on each round, then brush edge lightly with water and fold pastry over filling to form a half-moon. Press edges to seal. Shape each into a crescent by pushing a finger against middle of flat side.
Bake 1 inch apart on baking sheet until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer cookies on parchment to a rack to cool 2 minutes. Toss warm cookies, a few at a time, in confectioners sugar to coat generously. Cool completely.
Repeat with remaining dough (cool baking sheet and line with fresh parchment). Reroll scraps once for extra cookies if desired.

Espresso Blackberry Macarons
3 ounces almond flour (2/3 cup) or blanched sliced almonds (3/4 cup) or slivered almonds (2/3 cup)
1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
1 tablespoon instant-espresso powder
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 large egg whites, at room temperature 30 minutes
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
About 1/2 cup blackberry jelly
a food processor with a sharp blade or an electric coffee/spice grinder
a large pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain tip or a quart-size sealable bag with a corner snipped off
an offset spatula.

Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Grind almond flour or almonds with confectioners sugar in food processor until powdery, 30 seconds for almond flour, about 2 minutes for almonds. (If using grinder, grind in small batches.) Sift through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl (if not fine enough for almost all of nuts to go through sieve, regrind). Sift again into a large bowl.
Stir together espresso powder and vanilla in a cup until powder has dissolved.
Beat egg whites with salt in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Beat in granulated sugar, a little at a time. Increase speed to high and beat until meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks, about 1 minute. Add espresso mixture and mix at low speed until incorporated. Fold meringue into almond mixture with a rubber spatula until completely incorporated. (Meringue will deflate and batter will be loose.)
Put small dabs of batter under corners of parchment to secure to baking sheets.
Spoon half of batter into pastry bag. Holding bag vertically just above baking sheet, pipe 1 1/2-inch-wide mounds of batter about 1 inch apart, stopping pressure and flicking tip sideways to avoid peaks (tamp down any peaks with a wet finger). Refill pastry bag and repeat. Let macarons stand, uncovered, at room temperature until a light crust forms, 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 300 degrees F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Bake macarons, switching position of sheets halfway through, until crisp and interior does not give easily when gently pressed, 22 to 28 minutes total. Cool completely on baking sheets (to harden bottoms) on racks, about 30 minutes. Loosen macarons from parchment with offset spatula (they will be fragile).
Sandwich flat sides of macarons together with a thin layer of jelly.
Layer macarons between sheets of parchment in an airtight container and let stand at room temperature at least 2 hours to soften before eating.

Polenta Cake with Orange Blossom Yogurt, Berries, and Pistachios
1 3/4 cups plain low-fat yogurt
2 cups low-fat (1%) milk
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 cup polenta (not quick-cooking)
1/4 cup (1 ounce) unsalted pistachios, preferably organic (natural; not dyed red)
Olive oil (for brushing)
12 drops orange blossom water (also called orange flower water)*
1/2 cup rambutan honey or other high-quality organic or raw honey with a fruity, citrusy flavor
1 1/2 pounds strawberries, hulled and halved
*Available at supermarkets, liquor stores, and Middle Eastern markets.
2 (12-inch) squares cheesecloth
*Available at supermarkets, liquor stores, and Middle Eastern markets.

Line fine-mesh sieve with double layer cheesecloth and set over medium bowl. Transfer yogurt to lined sieve, then pull up and tie together edges of cheesecloth, wrapping yogurt into bundle. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to drain in refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight. (The yogurt can be prepared 2 days ahead. Once drained, transfer to airtight container and refrigerate, covered.)
In medium heavy saucepan, combine milk and sea salt with 3/4 cup water. Bring to boil over high heat, then gradually whisk in polenta, until smooth. Reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, whisking often, until very thick, about 25 minutes. Spread into 8- x 8-inch baking dish and cool slightly. Cover and chill until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight. (Polenta can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 day.)
Bring small pan of water to boil. Add pistachios and boil, uncovered, 1 minute. Drain, then roll between towels until brown papery skins are removed. Set pistachios aside.
If using charcoal grill, open vents on bottom, then light charcoal and preheat grill to moderately high. If using gas grill, preheat burners on high with hood closed 10 minutes, then turn down to moderately high. Brush grill rack with oil.
Cut polenta into 4 rectangles and grill, turning once, until heated through and crusty, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat and slice each rectangle in half diagonally to produce 2 wedges.
While polenta is on grill, transfer thickened yogurt to small bowl, discarding liquid, and stir in orange blossom water and honey.
Divide polenta wedges among 4 plates, top with yogurt, and garnish with strawberries and pistachios. Serve immediately.

Jack-O'-Lantern
2 tablespoons shortening
2 tablespoons flour
1 recipe Chocolate Cake Batter
1 recipe Creamy White Frosting
Green gel or paste food color
Orange gel or paste food color
1 small waffle ice cream cone
4 ounces (1/2 cup) black fondant
Black decorating sugar, for sprinkling
Two 6-inch half-sphere cake pans (such as Wilton Sports Ball set) or two 1 1/2-quart
ovenproof bowls
Waxed or parchment paper
Toothpicks
Wire cooling racks
Glass measuring cup
Small offset spatula
Cake plate or 4-inch round cardboard base (optional)
Plastic straw
2 decorating bags, #70 leaf tip, and #5 round tip
Rolling pin
Small, sharp knife
Small plate
Compote or shallow bowl, for serving

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the bottom of each cake pan, then line it with waxed paper or parchment paper and lightly grease and flour the bottom and sides. Divide the batter between the pans and bake the cakes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 minutes. Cool the cakes completely in the pans on cooling racks and then turn them out onto the racks.
2. While the cakes are cooling, transfer 1 cup of the frosting to a glass measuring cup. Tint it green (see Decorating Tips). Tint the remaining frosting orange.
3. Using an offset spatula, spread a thin layer of the orange frosting over the flat surface of 1 cake. Invert the second cake on top of the first, joining the flat surfaces of both domes together. Transfer the assembled cake to the cardboard base, if using, or a cake plate. Cover the cake completely with the rest of the orange frosting.
4. To make rib indentations as shown in the photo, hold a plastic straw against the cake, curving it from bottom to top. Lift it off, reposition it, and press again. Repeat all around the cake. (Gently incise the ribs with a skewer if you don't have a straw.)
5. For the stem, invert the ice cream cone and, using a clean spatula, cover it with the green frosting; add more frosting at the top to give the stem a curved tip. Place the stem on the top of the cake.
6. Fit a decorating bag with a coupler and the leaf tip; add 1 cup of the green frosting to the bag. Referring to the photo, pipe several leaves around the base of the stem. Hold the bag at an angle next to the stem. Squeeze out some frosting, allowing it to fan into a wide base, then decrease the pressure and slowly pull the tip away, lifting slightly, to form a point.
7. Remove the leaf tip and replace with the round tip. Pipe tendrils around the stem and leaves. Place the tip where you want the tendril to begin. Using even pressure, squeeze out some frosting and move the tip to draw the tendril. Release the pressure and lift the tip when the tendril is the desired length.
8. Using a rolling pin, roll the fondant to 1/8 inch thick. Referring to the photo and using a small, sharp knife, cut out the features. For the eyes, cut 2 triangles about 1 1/2 inches wide at the base and 1 1/2 inches tall at the center. For the nose, cut another triangle a little smaller than the eyes. Cut the smile to be about 4 inches from tip to tip. You can draw a paper pattern first if you like.
9. Spread the black sugar on a small plate (large enough to hold the smile) using the back of the spoon. Press each cutout into the sugar and then invert the coated cutout onto the pumpkin to form the face, pressing it into the frosting. Transfer the cake to the serving dish if you have not already done so.

Soft Lady Fingers

Lemon Icebox Cake
4 lemons
1 cup water plus additional for blanching
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3/4 cup chilled heavy cream
1 tablespoon confectioners sugar
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 (8- by 4-inch) store-bought all-butter pound cake (3/4 to 1 pound), chilled

Remove zest (peel) from 2 lemons in wide strips with a vegetable peeler (see Tips, page 118), then cut lengthwise with a sharp knife into 1/8-inch-wide julienne strips. Reserve lemons for juicing.
Fill a 2-quart heavy saucepan halfway with water, then add julienned peel. Bring to a boil and simmer 15 minutes. Drain peel in a sieve and rinse.
Bring water (1 cup) and 1 cup granulated sugar to a boil in saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Add peel and gently simmer until translucent, about 15 minutes.
Remove peel from syrup with a slotted spoon, letting syrup drain off into saucepan. Spread out on a sheet of wax paper and cool to room temperature.
Toss peel with remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, stirring with a fork to coat and separate. Transfer sugared peel to clean dry sieve and shake off excess sugar, then spread out on a fresh sheet of wax paper to dry slightly. Make lemon filling while peel simmers and cools: Grate enough zest from remaining 2 lemons with a rasp to measure 2 teaspoon, then squeeze enough juice from all lemons to measure 2/3 cup. Whisk together zest, juice, and condensed milk. Chill until cold, at least 30 minutes.
Beat heavy cream with confectioners sugar and vanilla in a chilled bowl with a whisk or electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks. assemble cake: Halve cake crosswise, then trim crust from all sides. Cut each block horizontally into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) squares. Halve each square diagonally into 2 triangles.
For each serving, layer 2 triangles with lemon filling, offsetting corners. Top cake with whipped cream and candied lemon peel.

Majestic and Moist New Year's Honey Cake
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup honey
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup warm coffee or strong tea
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup rye or whisky (see Note)
1/2 cup slivered or sliced almonds (optional)
I like this cake best baked in a 9-inch angel food cake pan, but you can also make it in a 10-inch tube or bundt cake pan, a 9-by-13-inch sheet pan, or three 8-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pans.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the pan(s). For tube and angel food pans, line the bottom with lightly greased parchment paper. For gift honey cakes, I use  inchcake collars inch (available from Sweet Celebrations) designed to fit a specific loaf pan. These give the cakes an appealing, professional look.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. Make a well in the center and add the oil, honey, sugars, eggs, vanilla, coffee, orange juice, and rye or whisky.
Using a strong wire whisk or an electric mixer on slow speed, combine the ingredients well to make a thick batter, making sure that no ingredients are stuck to the bottom of the bowl.
Spoon the batter into the prepared pan(s) and sprinkle the top of the cake(s) evenly with the almonds. Place the cake pan(s) on 2 baking sheets stacked together and bake until the cake springs back when you touch it gently in the center. For angel and tube cake pans, bake for 60 to 70 minutes; loaf cakes, 45 to 55 minutes. For sheet-style cakes, the baking time is 40 to 45 minutes. This is a liquidy batter and, depending on your oven, it may need extra time. Cake should spring back when gently pressed.
Let the cake stand for 15 minutes before removing it from the pan. Then invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Malted Milk Chocolate Cheesecake
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
One 10-ounce package butter biscuits, wafers, or shortbread cookies
1/3 cup walnuts
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
4 ounces (8 tablespoons, 1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and coole
14 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup malted milk powder
2 pounds cream cheese, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
4 extra-large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 quart boiling water
Essential Gear: 9 1/2-inch round springform pan, heavy-duty aluminum foil, food processor or rolling pin, double boiler, small saucepan, whisk, electric stand mixer with flat beater attachment, or large mixing bowl and handheld mixer, two rubber spatulas, fine-mesh strainer, 12-inch round cake pan or large roasting pan, cooling rack

Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 300 degrees F.
Using a paper towel or your fingertips, generously butter the inside of the springform pan. Use a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil to wrap tightly around the bottom of the pan. This prevents any water from the water bath seeping into the pan.
In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the cookies, walnuts, and sugar and pulse until the cookies are finely ground, about 2 minutes. Or place the cookies in a sturdy plastic bag and seal it. Use a rolling pin to crush the cookies to a very fine crumb consistency. Finely chop the walnuts and add them with the sugar to the cookies, seal the bag, and shake to blend together evenly.
Transfer the cookie crumb mixture to a medium bowl and add the butter. Use a rubber spatula or a spoon to toss the mixture together to moisten all of the cookie crumbs.
Transfer the crust to the prepared springform pan and use your fingertips to press it into the bottom and partway up the sides of the pan. Chill the crust while preparing the cheesecake batter.
Place the milk chocolate in the top of a double boiler over low heat. Stir often with a rubber spatula to help melt evenly. Remove the top pan of the double boiler and wipe the bottom and sides very dry.
Or place the milk chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and melt on low power for 30-second bursts. Stir with a rubber spatula after each burst.
Place the cream in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn off the heat, add the malted milk powder, and whisk to distribute evenly. Cover the pan and let the mixture steep for 10 minutes, then strain the cream.
Place the cream cheese in the bowl of an electric stand mixer or in a large bowl. Use the flat beater attachment or a hand-held mixer to beat the cream cheese on medium speed until it's fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Add the sugar and cream together very well. Stop occasionally and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
One at a time, add the eggs to the cream cheese mixture, beating well after each addition. At first the eggs will sit on top of the cream cheese mixture, but stop often to scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl with a rubber spatula. This will help the mixture to blend. The mixture may also look curdled as the eggs are added, but as you stop and scrape down the bowl, the mixture will smooth out.
Add the sour cream and vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and stir together to combine.
Add the strained cream to the batter and blend thoroughly, then add the melted milk chocolate and mix together.
Transfer the batter into the crust in the springform pan. Use a rubber spatula to smooth and even the top.
Place the springform pan in the larger cake pan or roasting pan and set the pan on the oven rack. Carefully pour the boiling water into the bottom pan until it reaches halfway up the side of the springform pan. Baking the cake in a water bath cushions it from the heat and adds extra moisture to the oven, which keeps the top of the cake from cracking.
Bake the cake for 1 hour and 45 minutes, until the top is set, but jiggles slightly. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the cheesecake to a rack.
Remove the foil and let the cheesecake cool completely. Cover the top of the cheesecake with waxed paper and wrap the pan tightly with aluminum foil. Refrigerate the cake for at least 6 hours before serving. To unmold the cheesecake, dip a thin-bladed knife in hot water and dry, then run it around the inner edge of the pan. Release the clip on the rim of the pan and gently lift it off the cake.
Store the cheesecake, covered with waxed paper and tightly wrapped with aluminum foil, in the refrigerator up to 4 days. To freeze up to 2 months, wrap the cake pan tightly in several layers of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Use a large piece of masking tape and an indelible marker to label and date the contents. If frozen, defrost overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature at least 30 minutes before serving.
Add 1 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts to the batter before turning it into the pan.
Drizzle the top of the cooled and chilled cheesecake with fine lines or designs of milk chocolate.
Serve each slice of cheesecake with a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream and scatter about 1 teaspoon of shaved milk chocolate over the cream.

Cinnamon Palmiers
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, frozen
5 to 6 tablespoons ice water
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon

Stir together flour and salt in a chilled large metal bowl. Coarsely grate frozen butter into flour, gently tossing to coat butter.
Drizzle 5 tablespoons ice water evenly over flour mixture and gently stir with a fork until incorporated. Test mixture by gently squeezing a small handful: When dough has the proper texture, it will hold together without crumbling apart. If necessary, add another tablespoon water, stirring until just incorporated, and test again. (Do not overwork dough or add too much water, or pastry will be tough; dough will be lumpy and streaky.)
Form dough into a 5-inch square, then chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Roll out dough on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 15- by 8-inch rectangle (with a short side nearest you). Brush off excess flour and fold dough into thirds like a letter. Rewrap dough and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Arrange dough with a short side nearest you on a floured surface and repeat rolling out, folding, and chilling 2 more times. Brush off any excess flour, then halve dough crosswise with a sharp knife and chill, wrapped separately in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour.
Stir together sugar and cinnamon, then generously sprinkle a clean work surface with some of cinnamon sugar and place 1 piece of chilled dough on top. Quickly roll out into a 16- by 12-inch rectangle (1/8 to 1/16 inch thick; if dough becomes too soft, chill on a baking sheet until firm). Trim edges with a sharp knife. Sprinkle top of dough evenly with some cinnamon sugar to cover completely, brushing off any excess. Fold 2 opposite long sides of pastry so they meet in center. Fold in same sides of pastry in same manner, then fold one half over the other (like a book) and press gently with a rolling pin to flatten slightly, forming a long rectangular log. Sprinkle with additional cinnamon sugar if dough is sticky.
Chill on a baking sheet, uncovered, until firm, at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. Meanwhile, repeat with remaining piece of dough and cinnamon sugar.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut 1 log of dough crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices with a sharp knife and arrange slices, cut sides down, 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden around edges, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from oven and turn palmiers over with a spatula. (If palmiers begin to unroll, gently press to reshape when cooled slightly.) Continue baking until golden all over and sugar is caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes more. Transfer as done (palmiers may not bake evenly) to a rack and cool. Make more cookies on cooled baking sheet lined with fresh parchment.

Arrange ladyfingers, rounded sides down, in single layer in bottom of 12-cup trifle dish (about 8 inches in diameter and 5 inches deep), covering bottom completely (using about 15 ladyfingers). Drizzle 5 tablespoons pear syrup evenly over ladyfingers. Using small offset spatula, spread 1/3 of white chocolate mousse over ladyfingers, making layer slightly thicker around outer edges of dish to allow mousse to be more visible (center of mousse layer will be thin). Starting at outer edges of dish, place pear slices in single layer with curved edges against sides of dish atop mousse, covering completely. Repeat layering of ladyfingers, syrup, mousse, and pears 2 more times. Cover with fourth layer of ladyfingers (some ladyfingers and pear slices may be left over). Drizzle ladyfingers evenly with 5 tablespoons syrup. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate trifle and remaining pear syrup separately.
Using electric mixer, beat 2 cups whipping cream in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add 1/4 cup pear syrup and beat until stiff peaks form. Working in batches, transfer cream to large pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe rosettes all over top of trifle, mounding slightly in center. Sprinkle with crystallized ginger. Garnish with chocolate curls. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.
Sift powdered sugar over trifle just before serving.

Vanilla Roll-Out Cookies
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all purpose flour
Sprinkles or other sugar decorations (optional)
Royal Icing (optional)

Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and salt and beat until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and beat in vanilla. Add flour and beat on low speed just to blend. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Form each half into ball and flatten into disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic and chill until firm, at least 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to 1/8-inch thickness for smaller (2-inch) cookies and 1/4-inch thickness for larger (3- to 4-inch) cookies. Using decorative cookie cutters, cut out cookies and transfer to prepared sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. If cookies become too soft to transfer to baking sheets, place in freezer on waxed paper for 5 minutes before continuing. Gather scraps, roll out dough, and cut more cookies, repeating until all dough is used. If not icing cookies, decorate with sprinkles or other sugar toppings, if desired.
Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are firm on top and golden around edges, about 10 minutes for smaller cookies and up to 14 minutes for larger cookies. Cool completely on rack. Decorate with Royal Icing, then sprinkles or other sugar toppings, if desired. Let stand until icing sets. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 days ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight containers.

Ginger Honey Cookies
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1/4 cup mild honey

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Whisk together flour, baking soda, ginger, and salt in a bowl.
Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Beat in egg and honey until combined. Reduce speed to low, then mix in flour mixture.
Drop 14 heaping tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart onto 2 ungreased baking sheets.
Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden, 10 to 14 minutes total (cookies will spread flat). Cool completely on sheets on racks.

Spiced Pumpkin Layer Cake
3 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 3/4 teaspoons ground allspice
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
1 cup canola oil
4 large eggs
1 15-ounce can pure pumpkin
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
3/4 cup raisins
3/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut plus additional for garnish
1 8-ounce package cream cheese, room temperature
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 tablespoon dark rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla paste
4 1/2 cups powdered sugar (measured, then sifted)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; dust pans with flour. Sift 3 cups flour and next 7 ingredients into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat both sugars and oil in large bowl until combined (mixture will look grainy). Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until well blended after each addition. Add pumpkin, vanilla, and orange peel; beat until well blended. Add flour mixture; beat just until incorporated. Stir in raisins and 3/4 cup coconut. Divide batter between prepared pans. Smooth tops.
Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool cakes completely in pans on rack. Run knife around cakes to loosen. Invert cakes onto racks; remove parchment paper. Turn cakes over, rounded side up. Using serrated knife, trim rounded tops of cakes to level.
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until smooth. Beat in dark rum and vanilla. Add powdered sugar in 3 additions, beating just until frosting is smooth after each addition (do not overbeat or frosting may become too soft to spread). Place 1 pumpkin cake layer, flat side down, on platter. Spread half of cream cheese frosting over top of cake to edges. Top with second cake layer, trimmed side down. Spread remaining frosting over top (not sides) of cake. Sprinkle additional coconut over. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with cake dome and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.
Cut cake into wedges and serve.
It's better to underbeat the frosting than overbeat it. That bit of restraint makes for a slightly firmer frosting that's easier to spread.

Orange Cheesecake with Candied Kumquats
2 cups water
2 cups sugar
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
9 ounces kumquats (about 25 medium), thinly sliced crosswise, seeds removed
2 cups vanilla wafer cookie crumbs (made from about 9 ounces cookies, finely ground in processor)
1/3 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
6 to 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 cup fresh orange juice
1 cup sugar, divided
2 tablespoons finely grated orange peel
4 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature
1 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 large eggs, room temperature

Combine water and sugar in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add kumquats; reduce heat. Simmer until kumquat slices are translucent, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat; cool kumquats in syrup. Strain kumquats, reserving syrup. Combine kumquats and 1/4 cup syrup in small bowl. Return remaining syrup to same saucepan; boil until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 8 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover separately and chill.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Combine cookie crumbs and brown sugar in medium bowl; add 6 tablespoons melted butter and stir until crumbs feel moist when pressed together with fingertips, adding remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter if mixture is dry. Press crumb mixture evenly onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Bake crust until set and edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool crust in pan on rack. Maintain oven temperature.
Wrap 4 layers of heavy-duty foil tightly around outside of pan with crust to make pan waterproof.
Combine orange juice, 1/4 cup sugar, and orange peel in small saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat. Simmer until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Chill until cool.
Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth. Mix in sour cream, flour, and salt. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in cooled orange juice mixture. Pour filling into crust; place springform pan in large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of springform pan.
Bake cake until just set in center, about 1 hour 35 minutes. Remove cake from roasting pan; remove foil. Place cake directly in refrigerator and chill overnight. Arrange kumquat slices atop cake, covering completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Tent cake with foil and refrigerate.
Remove pan sides; place cake on platter. Cut cake into wedges; drizzle some kumquat syrup over and serve.
The KUMQUAT SYRUP is perfect with the cakeâbut don't stop there. It's also yummy drizzled over vanilla or coffee ice cream or in a cup of tea, a glass of club soda, or even a vodka Martini.

1 12-ounce package semisweet chocolate chips
3 cups all purpose flour, divided
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 1/2 cups (packed) golden brown sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon maple extract
4 large eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons (or more) whipping cream
1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso powder

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Butter 12-cup Bundt pan. Spray pan generously with nonstick spray. Dust pan lightly with flour. Mix chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons flour in medium bowl.

2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 1/2 cups whole milk
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 vanilla beans, split lengthwise
2 16x3-inch strips waxed paper
5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 10-inch-diameter springform pans with 2 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Place chocolate and cocoa in medium bowl. Pour hot coffee and hot water over; whisk until smooth. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in another medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat oil and both sugars in large bowl 1 minute (mixture will be crumbly). Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Beat in sour cream. Mix in half of dry ingredients. Beat in chocolate mixture. Add remaining dry ingredients; beat on low speed just to blend (batter will be thin). Divide batter between pans (layers will be shallow).
Bake cakes until tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pans on rack.
Place 1/2 cup water in small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over; let soften 10 minutes. Place both chocolates in large metal bowl. Combine cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract in large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla beans; add beans. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; remove from heat. Add gelatin mixture; whisk to dissolve. Pour cream mixture over chocolates in bowl; whisk until completely melted. Place bowl over a larger bowl of ice water. Stir often until mixture thickens like pudding, draining off water and adding more ice to larger bowl as needed, about 30 minutes. Remove from over water.
Pour 1/2 of panna cotta over cake in 1 pan (mixture may drip down sides of cake). Freeze 45 minutes. Keep remaining panna cotta at room temperature.
Remove pan sides from second cake. Using large metal spatula, carefully slide cake off of pan bottom and place atop panna cotta in cake pan. Pour remaining panna cotta over, filling pan completely. Chill overnight. DO AHEAD: Can be covered and frozen for 2 weeks. Defrost overnight in refrigerator before continuing.
Line large baking sheet with foil; set aside. Place another large sheet of foil on work surface; place waxed paper strips atop foil, spacing apart. Stir chocolate in medium bowl set over pan of simmering water until smooth. Pour half of melted chocolate down center of each waxed paper strip. Using small offset spatula, spread chocolate to cover strips evenly, allowing some of chocolate to extend beyond edges of paper strips, making sure strips are completely covered. Using fingertips, lift strips and place on foil-lined sheet. Chill until chocolate just begins to set but is still completely flexible, about 2 minutes.
Cut around pan sides to release cake. Remove pan sides from cake. Using fingertips, lift 1 chocolate band from foil. Wrap band around cake, waxed-paper side out, lining up 1 long edge with bottom of cake (band will be higher than cake). Repeat with second band, arranging so ends just meet, pressing band onto uncovered side of cake. If bands overlap, trim any excess paper and chocolate. Using fingertips, press top edge of band in toward cake, forming slight ruffle. Chill until chocolate sets, 5 minutes. Gently peel off waxed paper. Chill cake. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill.

Chocolate Roll-Out Cookies
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, room temperature
1 1/3 cups sugar
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Sprinkles or other sugar decorations (optional)
Royal Icing (optional)

Sift first 5 ingredients and cinnamon, if desired, into medium bowl. Stir chocolate in metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Set aside. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and beat until mixture is pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and beat in vanilla and chocolate. Add flour mixture and beat on low speed just to blend. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Form each half into ball and flatten into disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic and chill until firm, at least 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before rolling out.
Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to 1/8-inch thickness for smaller (2-inch) cookies and 1/4-inch thickness for larger (3- to 4-inch) cookies. Using waxed paper prevents you from adding too much flour, which will make the cookies tough.
Using decorative cookie cutters, cut out cookies. Cold dough is much easier to work with. If it gets warm as you're cutting out the cookies, place the doughâwaxed paper and allâin the freezer for about 5 minutes.
Use an offset spatula to peel away the excess dough and transfer the cookies to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Gather scraps, roll out dough, and cut more cookies, repeating until all dough is used. If not icing cookies, decorate with sprinkles or other sugar toppings, if desired.
Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are firm on top and slightly darker around edges, about 9 minutes for smaller cookies and up to 12 minutes for larger cookies. Line baking sheets with fresh parchment as needed. Cool completely on rack. Decorate cookies with royal icing if desired. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 4 days ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight containers.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 15x10x1-inch baking sheet; line with parchment. Butter parchment. Whisk first 4 ingredients in large bowl. Melt butter in medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate chips; stir until melted. Whisk in 3/4 cup water, cocoa, and vanilla until blended. Whisk in egg. Add to dry ingredients; whisk to blend. Pour batter onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out with some moist crumbs attached, about 22 minutes. Cool cake on baking sheet on rack 15 minutes. Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake. Turn cake out onto sheet of foil; cool. Cut cake crosswise into 3 equal strips. Freeze cake strips 1 hour.
Place 1 cake strip on platter. Working quickly, spoon 3 1/2 cups peppermint ice cream in dollops over cake; spread evenly to edges. Top with second cake strip; spoon 3 1/2 cups ice cream in dollops over cake; spread evenly to edges. Top with third cake strip; freeze 1 hour. Spread enough remaining ice cream over top and sides of cake to cover generously (about 6 cups). Freeze until firm, about 3 hours.
Place 20-inch-long sheet of foil on work surface. Mark off 16x12-inch rectangle. Stir sugar, 1/2 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Increase heat and boil without stirring until candy thermometer registers 300 degrees F, tilting saucepan slightly to submerge bulb, about 15 minutes.
Being very careful (syrup is extremely hot), pour boiling syrup in wide zigzag lines across foil. Working quickly and using offset metal spatula, spread syrup evenly to 16x12-inch rectangle. Immediately sprinkle generously with candies, pressing larger pieces into syrup to adhere (do not touch hot syrup). If syrup hardens before all candies have been applied, slide foil with brittle onto large rimless baking sheet and place baking sheet directly over burner set on high heat to soften syrup, about 10 seconds, rotating sheet, then remove from heat and immediately apply remaining candies. Cool completely.
Starting at 1 end of brittle, break off irregular pieces, peeling foil as you go. Press brittle upright, candy side out, onto top and sides of cake and freeze. DO AHEAD: Cake can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.
Bring water to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate; whisk until smooth. DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm sauce before continuing.

Fluffy White Cake
1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, plus additional for greasing pans
4 3/4 cups cake flour, sifted, plus additional for dusting pans
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups whole milk
1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups sugar
9 large egg whites

Arrange oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter cake pans and line bottom of each with round of parchment. Butter paper, then dust pans with flour, knocking out excess.
In large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In small bowl, combine milk and vanilla.
In bowl of electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar on moderate speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low. Add 1/2 of flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add milk mixture and beat until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and beat until just combined, then raise speed to moderately high and beat 10 seconds. Transfer to large bowl.
In clean bowl of electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites until they hold stiff peaks.
Fold 1/3 of egg whites into batter to lighten. Gently fold in remaining 2/3 of egg whites until just incorporated. Divide batter between prepared pans and smooth tops.
Bake cakes until tops are springy to touch and testers come out clean, about 30 minutes for 6-inch cake, 45 minutes for 9-inch cake, and 60 minutes for 12-inch cake. Cool cakes in pans on racks 30 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks, peel off parchment, and cool cakes completely.
(Cakes may be stored at room temperature, tightly wrapped, 2 days; refrigerated up to 5 days; or frozen, double-wrapped, up to 2 weeks. Do not unwrap before thawing.)

White Elephant Cake with Buttercream Frosting
3 1/2 cups flour
5 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
16 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2 cups sugar
4 eggs
1/3 cup canned coconut milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups sugar
6 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
A pinch of salt
1 1/4 pounds unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until the mixture is light yellow. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the coconut milk and the flour mixture alternately, ending with the flour mixture, and continuing to beat well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla.
2. Divide the batter evenly among 3 lightly buttered and floured 8-inch square pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool in the pan, then invert onto cooling racks.
3. To create a 4-tiered cake, cut a 2-inch, 4-inch, and 6-inch square out of 2 of the cakes. Using sturdy cardboard, cut precise squares of the same dimensions. Place the cut cakes on the corresponding cardboard squares (they will serve as bases).
4. Insert 4 heavy-duty plastic straws, cut to 6-inch lengths, into the center of the remaining 8-inch cake, forming a square (they will act as the support for the 6-inch cake). Place the 6-inch cake on top of the 8-inch cake. Repeat this process with four more straws on the 6-inch cake, then place the 4-inch cake on top. Repeat the procedure for the 2-inch cake.
1. Cream the butter in a bowl until light and fluffy; set aside.
2. Combine 2/3 cup water and the sugar in a heavy saucepan. Heat until the liquid reaches the soft-ball stage, 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Watch carefully; do not let the sugar syrup overheat.
3. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and salt until very stiff peaks form. Continue beating on high speed as you slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the sugar syrup. Gradually add the rest of the syrup using the same method.
4. Continue beating as you add the butter, several tablespoons at a time. (Make sure the mixture has no heat left in it or the butter will melt). The frosting should become thick and creamy. If it doesn't thicken, cool it over a bowl of ice, then try beating again. Stir in the vanilla. Frost the cake and adorn it with elephant cookies ($8 to $12 each, elenis.com).

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Butter pans. Line bottoms with parchment, then butter and lightly flour pans.
Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.
Beat butter with sugar using an electric mixer (paddle attachment for a stand mixer) at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 with a handheld. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then vanilla, and beat until thoroughly incorporated, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 4 batches alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing until batter is just smooth.
Stand cones, open ends up, in a 12-cup muffin pan and fill cones two-thirds full with batter. Divide remaining batter between cake pans.
Bake cones in upper third of oven and cakes in lower third until a wooden pick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 15 to 22 minutes for cones, 25 to 35 minutes for cakes. Cool cakes 5 minutes in pans on a large rack and transfer cones to another rack to cool completely. Invert cakes onto rack and cool completely.
Bring milk just to a boil in a medium saucepan. Whisk together yolks, sugar, and salt in a bowl until combined well, then add milk in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Transfer to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until custard thickens and registers 175 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes (do not let boil). Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a metal bowl. Refrigerate, covered, until cold, at least 1 hour.
Melt chocolate, then cool to warm.
Beat butter with cleaned beaters (whisk attachment if using stand mixer) at high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes in a stand mixer or 4 with a handheld. Reduce speed to medium and gradually pour in cold custard. Add vanilla and increase speed to high, then beat until buttercream is smooth, about 2 minutes in a stand mixer or 4 with a handheld.
Transfer 1 1/4 cups buttercream to a bowl and stir in warm melted chocolate to make chocolate buttercream. Transfer about 2 cups vanilla buttercream to another bowl and fold in crushed wafers to make cookies-and-cream filling.

Scoop out about 1 teaspoon of cake crumbs from the center of each cupcake and replace them with 11/2teaspoons of lemon curd. Place the top back on each cupcake, sticking it back together with the lemon curd. Spread the top of each cupcake with some frosting and dust with the colored sugars. Allow the frosting to set for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Oatmeal Cookies with Chocolate Chunks and Candied Ginger
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1 1/4 cups (packed) brown sugar
1 large egg
1/4 cup honey
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
6 ounces semisweet chocolate (60 to 65 percent cocoa), coarsely chopped (about 1 1/4 cups)
1 cup crystallized ginger, finely chopped

Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
In food processor, combine oats, all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, salt, and baking soda. Pulse until oats are coarsely chopped, about 6 (1-second) pulses. Set aside.
Using electric mixer at high speed, beat butter and brown sugar until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add egg, honey, and vanilla and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Add oat mixture and mix at low speed just until incorporated. Stir in chocolate and ginger.
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough about 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Bake, 2 pans at a time, switching positions of pans halfway through baking, until golden and slightly crisp on edges, about 14 to 16 minutes. Cool on sheets 3 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Continue making cookies with remaining dough and cooled sheets.
To keep them fresh, pack the cookies in covered containers with waxed paper between each layer. If it's very hot out, you may want to refrigerate them until you leave to ensure that they won't melt before dessert time.

Coconut Cheesecake with Mango Sauce
11 whole graham crackers (to yield about 1 1/3 cups crumbs)
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1 teaspoon pure coconut extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup cream of coconut (such as Coco LÃ³pez brand)
1 envelope unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled
16 ounces cream cheese, softened and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 teaspoon pure coconut extract
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
One 14-ounce bag frozen mango puree, thawed
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon dark rum

1. To make the crust, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the graham crackers in the work bowl of a food processor and process until finely ground. Combine the crumbs, butter, coconut, coconut extract, and salt in a medium-size mixing bowl and stir until moistened.
2. Press the mixture evenly across the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan, packing it tightly with your fingertips so it is even and compacted. Bake until crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool completely. (The crust may be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 1 month.)
3. To make the filling, place 1/2 cup of the cream of coconut in a small heatproof bowl, sprinkle the gelatin on top, and let soften for 5 minutes. Put 1 inch of water in a small saucepan and bring to a bare simmer. Place the bowl over the simmering water and heat, whisking constantly, just until the gelatin melts, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
4. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Beat in the cream cheese and the remaining 1/2 cup cream of coconut until the mixture is almost smooth (a few small lumps are okay), 1 minute more. Stir in the coconut extract and vanilla extract. With the mixer running, pour in the liquefied gelatin. Continue to beat until the mixture is light and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Scrape the filling into the prepared crust, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours and up to 2 days.
6. To make the sauce, push the mango puree through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any strings or tough fibers. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and rum. (You may refrigerate the sauce in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)
7. Release the sides of the pan from the cheesecake. Drizzle Mango Sauce on dessert plates and then place a slice of cake over the sauce on each plate. Serve immediately.

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup confectioners sugar
Parchment paper

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan in oven until skins split and nuts are pale golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven (turn oven off), then wrap hazelnuts in a kitchen towel and rub to remove any loose skins. Cool nuts completely. Pulse nuts with granulated sugar in a food processor until finely chopped.
Melt chocolate in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water or in top of a double boiler, stirring until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and set aside.
Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Beat together butter and brown sugar in another bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in melted chocolate until combined. Add milk and vanilla, beating to incorporate. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Stir in nut mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill dough until firm, 2 to 3 hours.
Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Sift confectioners sugar into a bowl. Halve dough and chill 1 half, wrapped in plastic wrap. Roll remaining half into 1-inch balls, placing them on a sheet of wax paper as rolled. Roll balls, 3 or 4 at a time, in confectioners sugar to coat generously and arrange 2 inches apart on lined baking sheets.
Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until cookies are puffed and cracked and edges feel dry (but centers are still slightly soft), 12 to 18 minutes total. Transfer cookies (still on parchment) to racks to cool completely.
While first batch is baking, roll remaining dough into balls. Line cooled cookie sheets with fresh parchment, then coat balls with confectioners sugar and bake in same manner.

Raspberry Chocolate French Macaroons
6 oz sliced blanched almonds (not slivered; 2 cups)
1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
3 large egg whites
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
Red or pink food coloring
3 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (60 to 64% cacao), finely chopped
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
1/16 teaspoon raspberry extract (preferably McCormick brand)
parchment paper; a gallon-size sealable plastic bag (not pleated)

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Pulse almonds with 1/2 cup confectioners sugar in a food processor until very finely ground, 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a bowl. Sift in remaining cup confectioners sugar, stirring to combine.
Beat egg whites with salt in another bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Add granulated sugar, a little at a time, beating, then increase speed to high and continue to beat until whites just hold stiff, glossy peaks. Add drops of food coloring to reach desired shade and mix at low speed until evenly combined. Stir almond mixture into meringue with a rubber spatula until completely incorporated. (Meringue will deflate.)
Spoon batter into bag, pressing out excess air, and snip off 1 corner of plastic bag to create a 1/4-inch opening. Twist bag firmly just above batter, then pipe peaked mounds of batter (the size of a chocolate kiss) onto lined sheets about 1 1/2 inches apart. Let cookies stand, uncovered, at room temperature until tops are no longer sticky and a light crust forms, 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until crisp and edges are just slightly darker, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely on sheets on racks, about 30 minutes.
Melt chocolate with cream in a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water or in top of a double boiler, stirring until smooth. (Bowl should not touch water.) Remove bowl from heat, then add butter and raspberry extract, stirring until butter is melted. Let stand at room temperature until cooled completely and slightly thickened.
Carefully peel cookies from parchment (they will be fragile). Sandwich a thin layer of ganache (about 1/2 teaspoon) between flat sides of cookies.

Butter-Nut Blondies
One half cup (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter
2 cups (15 ounces) packed dark brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon vinegar, preferably apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon butter-rum, butterscotch or butter-pecan flavor (optional but delicious)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups (6 ounces) traditional whole wheat flour
1 1/2 (5 5/8 ounces) chopped pecans or walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees  F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch pan. Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl or in a saucepan set over low heat. Remove from the heat and add the sugar, mixing until well blended. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and let it cool to lukewarm.
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vinegar, vanilla, flavor (if using), baking powder and salt. Stir in the flour and nuts. Spread the batter in the prepared pan.
Bake the blondies until the top looks shiny, 26 to 28 minutes. Don't overbake; bake just until the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan and a sharp knife tip poked into the very center reveals sticky crumbs but not wet batter. Remove from the oven and run a knife all around the edge of the pan; this will help keep the blondies flat as they cool, by allowing the edges to settle in the pan along with the middle. Cool completely before cutting. If you prefer squares with a very smooth texture, wait 24 hours before cutting; this waiting period gives the bran in the whole wheat time to soften up.

Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes more. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition, then beat in vanilla. Add flour mixture and beat on low just until combined.
Divide dough in half. Form 1 half into 4- by 4-inch square, wrap in plastic wrap, and set aside. Return other half to mixer. In metal bowl set over pan of barely simmering water, melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. Add melted chocolate to dough in mixer and beat just until combined. Form chocolate dough into 4- by 4-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate both squares of dough 30 minutes.
Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut each dough square into 4 strips. Place 3 strips of chocolate dough and 4 strips of vanilla dough on baking sheet and refrigerate. Between 2 sheets of parchment paper, roll out 4th strip of chocolate dough into 6- by 7-inch rectangle (use ruler to make sure dimensions are exact). Remove 1 strip of vanilla dough from refrigerator and, between 2 sheets of parchment paper, roll out into 6- by 6-inch square. Peel off top sheet of parchment from each dough and flip vanilla dough over onto chocolate, aligning top and bottom edges and allowing 1/2 inch of chocolate dough to stick out on each side. Run rolling pin lightly over doughs to adhere, then peel off top sheet of parchment. Fold extra 1/2 inch of chocolate dough over vanilla on 1 side. Starting on folded-over side and using parchment as aid, tightly roll up dough into log. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Repeat with remaining strips of dough to form 4 logs.
Refrigerate logs 1 hour, then remove from refrigerator and roll each log on counter several times to prevent bottom from flattening. Refrigerate 3 hours more, then transfer to freezer. When frozen, wrap in parchment paper, twist ends, and tie with decorative ribbon. Attach card with baking instructions for each log:
Keep dough frozen until ready to slice and bake. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease 2 large baking sheets. Using sharp knife, slice dough into 1/4-inch-thick slices and place 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet. Bake until vanilla dough is slightly golden, 9 to 11 minutes. Makes 20 cookies.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Quarter dough. Keeping remaining 3 pieces wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled, roll out 1 piece of dough on a lightly floured sheet of wax paper with a lightly floured rolling pin to 3/4 inch thick. (If dough becomes too soft to roll out, chill on wax paper until firm.) Cut out rounds with cutter and transfer to 1 lined baking sheet, arranging cookies about 2 inches apart.
Bake cookies until slightly puffed and a shade darker, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool 5 minutes on sheet. If desired, make holes with piping tip near edges to hang cookies, then transfer cookies (still on parchment) to a rack to cool completely. (Cookies will flatten slightly as they cool.)
While first batch is baking, roll out and cut another batch, arranging cookies on second lined sheet. Bake in same manner, then gather scraps and chill until dough is firm enough to reroll, 15 to 20 minutes. Make more cookies with scraps (reroll scraps only once) and remaining pieces of dough, cooling sheets and lining them with fresh parchment before using.

Chestnut Cheesecake
4 ounces (2 cups) Graham cracker crumbs
1/2 stick butter
1 heaped tablespoon sweetened chestnut purÃ©e
2 cups cream cheese
3/4 cup superfine sugar
3 eggs
3 egg yolks
3/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1â2 tablespoons rum
1 cup sweetened chestnut purÃ©e
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup rum
1 tablespoon sweetened chestnut purÃ©e
1/4 cup superfine sugar
1 tablespoon butter

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and put the kettle on to boil.
For the base, process the crackers, butter and heaped tablespoon chestnut purÃ©e until like fine crumbs. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan and place in the fridge while you make the filling.
Beat the cream cheese until smooth and add the sugar. Add the eggs and egg yolks, beating them in one by one until they are incorporated into the cream cheese and sugar. Pour in the sour cream, lime juice, vanilla extract and rum, and beat again until smooth and creamy. Finally fold in the sweetened chestnut purÃ©e. Don't worry about making a fully amalgamated mixture: smooth cream cheese with grainy streaks of chestnut is just fine.
Line the outside of the springform pan containing the crumb base with a good wrapping of plastic wrap, so that the whole of the bottom and sides are enveloped in plastic. Do the same with aluminum foil, covering the layer of plastic wrap to make a very watertight casing. Stand the springform, thus covered, in a roasting pan and pour in the chestnut filling. Once that's done, pour water from a recently boiled kettle into the roasting pan to come just over an inch up the side of the pan (the plastic wrap will make it bob up and down a bit) and place in the oven to cook for an hour.
When the cheesecake's ready it should be just set on top with a hint of wobble underneath; it certainly carries on cooking as it cools. Take the cheesecake out of the roasting pan, take off the foil and plastic wrap and let the cheesecake cool on a rack. Refrigerate overnight before unmolding and leaving it to get back to room temperature. If you need to unmold it long before you want to eat it (I often do just because I like to get all bothersome stuff out of the way before people arrive) then just sit it on its serving plate in the fridge until about 20â30 minutes before you want to eat it. I'd take it out as you sit down to dinner or lunch or whatever.
You can make the syrup in advance but do not pour over until the actual point of serving.
You just put all of the syrup ingredients into a saucepan and melt together. Let the syrup boil for 10 minutes, then cool to just warmish (or even room temperature) before criss-crossing the top of the cheesecake with it.

Pour over nuts and mix thoroughly. Transfer nut mixture to 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Using plastic wrap as aid, press firmly up sides and then over bottom of pan, covering completely. Freeze 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F. Place pan with crust on cookie sheet and bake 20 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool.
Melt 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate in top of double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Spread over bottom of crust. Cover with plastic and freeze until ready to use.
Melt white chocolate in top of double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat. Cook sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until candy thermometer registers 238F (tilting pan slightly to submerge thermometer), about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat yolks in medium bowl until pale yellow and thick.
Gradually beat hot syrup into yolks. Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Continue beating until thick and cool, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
In large bowl, whip 2 1/4 cups cream, brandy, vanilla and nutmeg to firm peaks. Fold barely lukewarm white chocolate into yolk mixture. Gently fold in whipped cream. Pour 1/3 of filling into crust; smooth top. Top with 1 chocolate disk. Gently pour another 1/3 of filling over; smooth top. Top with second chocolate disk. Gently pour remaining filling over.

Caramel Macadamia Nut Crunch
1 cup sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 pound macadamia pieces, or whole nuts, roughly chopped
1 chilled log of butter shortbread cookie dough

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet, preferably rimmed.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and 1/2 cup of water. Heat over medium heat until mixture begins to simmer, about 3 minutes. Cover the pan and continue to simmer, allowing steam from cooking mixture to wash down the sides of the pan. Remove cover and continue to simmer until the mixture turns golden, 7 to 8 minutes.

Blackberry Brown-Sugar Cake
1 lb blackberries (about 3 1/2 cups)
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2/3 cup walnuts (2 oz)
1 cup granulated sugar
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened, plus additional for greasing pans
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup well-shaken buttermilk
1 teaspoon finely grated fresh orange zest
2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs

1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 lb blackberries (about 3 1/2 cups)
a heavy-duty stand mixer with whisk and paddle attachments; 3 (8-inch) round cake pans; 3 cooling racks; a candy thermometer

Mash blackberries with sugar using a potato masher or fork in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan. Cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 7 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, then force through a sieve into a bowl, discarding seeds. Chill jam, its surface covered with wax paper, until softly set, at least 15 minutes.
Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Pulse walnuts with 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a food processor until finely ground.
Generously butter cake pans and put a rounded 1/3 cup nut mixture into each pan. Tilt each pan to coat bottom and sides with nut mixture, letting excess remain in bottom of pan.
Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir together buttermilk, orange zest and juice, and vanilla in a small bowl.
Beat together butter (2 sticks), brown sugar, and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in bowl of mixer with paddle attachment at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce speed to low and add flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing just until batter is smooth. Divide batter among cake pans.
Bake, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until a wooden pick or skewer inserted in centers of cakes comes out clean and edges begin to pull away from sides of pans, about 30 minutes. Cool in pans on racks 15 minutes, then run a thin knife around edge of each pan. Invert racks over pans, then flip cakes onto racks to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Put egg whites and salt in cleaned bowl of mixer.
Bring brown sugar and water to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and washing down side of pan occasionally with a pastry brush dipped in water. When sugar syrup reaches a boil, start beating egg whites with whisk attachment at medium-high speed until whites just hold soft peaks. (Do not beat again until sugar syrup is ready.)
Meanwhile, put thermometer into sugar syrup and continue boiling until syrup reaches 238 to 242 degrees F (soft ball stage). Immediately remove from heat and, with mixer at high speed, slowly pour hot syrup down side of bowl into egg whites (avoid beaters), beating constantly.
Continue to beat meringue, scraping down bowl once or twice with a rubber spatula, until meringue is cool to the touch, about 10 minutes. (It is important that meringue is properly cooled before proceeding.)
With mixer at medium speed, gradually add butter to meringue 1 piece at a time, beating well after each addition and until incorporated. (If meringue is too warm and buttercream looks soupy after some of butter is added, briefly chill bottom of bowl in a large bowl filled with ice water for a few seconds before continuing to beat in remaining butter.) Continue beating until buttercream is smooth. (Mixture may look curdled before all of butter is added, but will come back together as beating continues.) Add vanilla and beat 1 minute more.
Put 1 cake layer, nut side up, on a cake plate or platter. Spread 1 1/2 cups buttercream on top but not side, then top with another cake layer, nut side up. Spread top with 1 1/2 cups buttercream, then top with remaining layer, nut side up.
Gently toss whole blackberries with jam in a large bowl. Arrange blackberries, stemmed sides down, on top of cake.

Lemon Curd Marbled Cheesecake
1 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup sugar
3 large eggs
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 1/3 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs (5 oz)
1/3 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
3 (8-oz) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
3 large eggs
3/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
Accompaniment: blueberries
a 9- to 91/2-inch (24-cm) springform pan

Whisk together zest, juice, sugar, and eggs in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Add butter and cook over moderately low heat, whisking frequently, until curd is thick enough to hold marks of whisk and first bubbles appear on surface, about 6 minutes.
Force lemon curd through a fine-mesh sieve into a wide shallow dish, scraping bottom of sieve, then cover surface with wax paper. Cool completely, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform pan (to make it easier to slide cake off bottom), then lock on side. 3Stir together crust ingredients in a bowl, then press onto bottom and 1 inch up side of springform pan. Place springform pan in a shallow baking pan and bake 10 minutes, then cool crust completely in springform pan on a rack.
Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F.
Beat together cream cheese and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add eggs 1 at a time, beating until incorporated. Beat in sour cream and vanilla until combined.
Pour two thirds of cream cheese filling into crust, then spoon half of lemon curd over filling and swirl curd into filling with a small knife. (Avoid touching crust with knife to prevent crumbs getting into filling.) Repeat with remaining filling and curd.
Bake cheesecake until set 1 1/2 inches from edge but center trembles when pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes. (Center of cake will appear very loose but will continue to set as it cools.) Transfer springform pan to a rack and immediately run a knife around top edge of cake to loosen. Cool completely, about 2 hours, then chill, uncovered, at least 4 hours. Remove side of springform pan before serving.

Black and Tans

1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup well-shaken buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1/4 cup half and half
1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch process cocoa such as Periginotti
2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
1/4 cup half and half
a small offset spatula

Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 2 large baking sheets.
Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir together buttermilk and vanilla in a cup. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, then add egg, beating until combined well. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and buttermilk mixture alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture, and mixing just until smooth.
Drop rounded teaspoons of batter 1 inch apart onto baking sheets. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until tops are puffed, edges are pale golden, and cookies spring back when touched, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a rack to cool.
Mix peanut butter and butter together with a hand mixer. Gradually blend in the sugar and half and half. Blend until fluffy and light. Can be prepared a day or two in advance, tightly wrapped, and refrigerated. Allow to come to room temperature before using.

Pound Cake Squares with Berries
2 boxes pound cake mix
6 tablespoons butter, melted
3 cups whipping cream
1 cup sugar
2 cups mixed berries (we used strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries)

Bake each pound cake in a loaf pan according to package directions. Allow to cool. Using a large serrated knife, trim crust off all sides of cake to make an even rectangle. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise. Cut each long section crosswise three times to make 16 small squares. Repeat with second loaf.
Using a small serrated knife, cut a square from the center of each cube, leaving a 1/2-inch wall around the edges. Remove the cut sections carefully, making sure to leave enough cake on the bottom to hold the filling.
Place the squares on an unlined baking sheet. Brush the upper edges of the cake squares with the melted butter using a pastry brush. Place under broiler for a few minutes until lightly toasted, making sure to watch closely â the squares brown quickly. Remove from oven and let cool.
These can be made up to 2 days ahead. If storing, pound cake squares can be transferred to airtight containers or placed closely together on a baking sheet and covered with plastic wrap, and stored in the refrigerator.
Place the whipping cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip until soft peaks form. Add the sugar slowly and whip until slightly stiff. Place a spoonful of whipped cream on each square, topped with sliced and whole berries, and serve.

Spread an even layer of softened raspberry sorbet on top of the mango sorbet (a 4 1/2-inch nesting bowl helps with this) and freeze for another 30 minutes. Finally, spoon in enough softened strawberry ice cream to fill the bowl. Freeze until hard.
To unmold, dip the bowl up to the rim in warm water. Run a knife around the edge to loosen the bombe and unmold upside down onto a flat plate. You may need to run a flexible metal spatula along the edge of the bombe to release it. Freeze until ready to serve. Serve in wedges.

Frozen Lemon Meringue Cake
4 large egg whites at room temperature for 30 minutes
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 medium lemons)
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest (from 2 medium lemons)
2/3 cup sugar
4 large egg yolks
2 whole large eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon pieces
1 pint (2 cups) vanilla ice cream (preferably premium)
2 (15- by 12-inch) sheets of parchment paper; an 8-inch (20-cm) springform pan

Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 200 degrees F.
Using the bottom of the springform pan as a guide, draw 2 (8-inch) circles on one sheet of parchment and a third (8-inch) circle on the second sheet of parchment. Turn paper over (circles will be visible).
Beat whites with cream of tartar and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they hold soft peaks. Beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, then increase speed to high and continue beating until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, about 4 minutes in a stand mixer or 8 to 10 minutes with a handheld. Divide meringue mixture among 3 circles, spread evenly within lines, and gently smooth tops. Bake until firm and very pale golden, about 2 hours, then let stand in turned-off oven (door closed) until firm, about 1 hour. While meringues bake, put ice cream in refrigerator to soften.
Slide parchment sheets with meringue layers onto racks to cool completely. Carefully lift meringue and peel off parchment.
Whisk together lemon juice, zest, sugar, yolks, whole eggs, and salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Stir in butter and cook over moderately low heat, whisking frequently, until mixture is thickened and just reaches a boil, about 6 minutes. Transfer lemon curd to a bowl and chill, its surface covered with plastic wrap, until cold, at least 1 hour.
Line springform pan with 2 crisscrossed sheets of plastic wrap. Arrange 1 meringue layer (trimming if necessary) flat side down in springform pan and spread 1 cup ice cream over it, then evenly spread half of lemon curd over ice cream. Cover curd with another meringue layer, then spread remaining cup ice cream over meringue. Spread remaining curd on top, then cover curd with remaining meringue layer, flat side down. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.
About 1 hour before serving, put cake in refrigerator to soften slightly. Remove side of pan and transfer cake to platter, then cut into wedges with a long serrated knife.

Chocolate SoufflÃ© Cake with Orange Caramel Sauce
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus additional for greasing pan
9 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not more than 60% cacao if marked), chopped
6 large eggs, separated
2/3 cup plus 1/2 cup superfine granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 navel or Valencia oranges
a 10-inch springform pan

Put a small roasting pan filled halfway with hot water in bottom third of oven (to provide moisture during baking). Position another oven rack in middle of oven, then preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Butter springform pan and line bottom with a round of parchment or wax paper. Butter paper.
Melt butter (2 sticks) and chocolate together in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring, then remove from heat. Beat together yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until thick enough to form a ribbon that takes 2 seconds to dissolve into mixture when beater is lifted, 6 to 8 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 to 14 minutes with a handheld. Stir warm chocolate mixture into yolk mixture until combined well.
Beat whites in another large bowl with cleaned beaters at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar, beating until whites just hold stiff peaks. Stir one fourth of whites into chocolate mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Pour batter into springform pan and bake in middle of oven (do not place springform pan in hot water) until a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center comes out with crumbs adhering, about 1 hour (a crust will form and crack on top of cake as it bakes). Transfer to a rack and cool 10 minutes (cake will  inchdeflate inch as it cools).
Run a thin knife carefully around edge of cake, then remove side of pan. Cool cake on bottom of pan 30 minutes. Invert a rack over cake and invert cake onto rack, then remove bottom of pan and carefully peel off paper. Invert a serving plate over cake, then invert cake onto plate.
Remove zest from 2 oranges and trim any white pith from zest with a paring knife. Cut enough very thin strips of zest to measure 1/4 cup. Squeeze juice from all 3 oranges and pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Measure out 1 cup juice and reserve remainder for another use.
Cook remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a dry 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel. Add zest and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Tilt pan and carefully pour in juice (caramel will harden and steam vigorously). Cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved, then cool sauce.
Serve cake with orange caramel sauce.

Almond Butter Cake
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, frozen
1/2 cup ice water
1/4 cup pure almond paste (2 oz)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 large egg
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 whole almond or a dried bean, such as a lima bean
1 large egg
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 tablespoon confectioners sugar for dusting
a pastry or bench scraper; 2 large baking sheets (at least 12 inches wide), not dark metal (or pastry may overbrown)

Sift together flour, salt, and sugar into a chilled large metal bowl. Set a grater over flour mixture and coarsely grate frozen butter into flour, gently lifting flour and tossing to coat butter.
Drizzle ice water evenly over flour mixture and gently stir with a fork until incorporated. Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 6 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together with scraper and form into a 6- to 7-inch square. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour. (Dough will be lumpy and streaky.)
PurÃ©e almond paste, sugar, butter, and a pinch of salt in a food processor until smooth. Add egg, vanilla, and almond extract and purÃ©e until incorporated. Add flour and pulse until incorporated. Transfer to a small bowl and chill, covered, to firm at least 1 hour.
Roll out dough on a well-floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 21- by 7-inch rectangle and arrange rectangle with a short side nearest you. Fold into thirds, first the top down and then the bottom up (like a letter), brushing off excess flour, to form a roughly 7-inch square. Rewrap dough and chill 20 minutes.
Arrange square on floured surface so that a side with 3 layers visible is nearest you and roll into a 21- by 7-inch rectangle, rolling lengthwise away from and toward yourself, but not side to side. Fold in thirds, brush off excess flour, and chill 20 minutes. Repeat rolling out, folding in thirds, and chilling 3 more times. After last round of rolling and folding, chill rewrapped dough 1 hour.
Roll out dough in same manner into a rectangle 24 inches long, then cut in half crosswise. On a floured surface, roll out each piece of pastry into a 12-inch square and transfer to separate baking sheets by rolling pastry around rolling pin, brushing off excess flour, then unrolling onto baking sheets. Chill squares until firm, about 10 minutes in freezer or 30 minutes in refrigerator.
Put an oven rack in lowest position and another in top third of oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Stir together egg and milk in a small bowl with a fork to make an egg wash.
Using a plate as a guide, cut 1 pastry square on baking sheet into an 11-inch round, reserving excess dough for another use. Using tip of a knife and a smaller plate as a guide, score a 9-inch circle, leaving a 1-inch border all around. (If at any time pastry becomes too soft to work with, chill until firm.) Cut a 1/2-inch circle in center of round to serve as a steam vent, then score curved lines close together inside 9-inch circle in a pinwheel design and lightly brush pastry all over with egg wash. Chill scored pastry on a baking sheet while preparing remaining pastry.
Cut remaining square into an 11-inch round in same manner. Brush some of egg wash in a 1-inch wide border around edge of round and mound chilled filling in center, spreading to about 1 1/2 inches from edge. Bury almond or bean anywhere in filling. Slide chilled pastry round gently over filling, scored side up, and press edges of rounds together to seal. Cut decorative notches, 1 inch apart, around sealed edge of galette.
Using a fine-mesh sieve, dust top of galette with confectioners sugar.
Bake on baking sheet on bottom rack of oven until puffed and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer galette to upper third of oven and continue baking until very puffed and deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes (galette will deflate slightly). Serve warm.

3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-process)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1 lb cold lard
2 tablespoons sweet Marsala wine
1 large egg, separated
About 3 cups vegetable oil
1 lb fresh ricotta (2 cups)
2 oz soft mild goat cheese
1/4 cup confectioners sugar
1 tablespoon minced candied orange peel
1/2 teaspoon orange-flower water (also called orange-blossom water)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup shelled unsalted pistachios (not dyed red), chopped
2 oz bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped (1/2 cup)
Garnish: confectioners sugar
a pasta maker; a 4- to 4 1/4-inch round cookie cutter; a deep-fat thermometer; 6 (roughly 5 5/8- by 5/8-inch) metal cannoli tubes; 2 heavy-duty oven mitts; a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch plain tip

Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda. Add 2 tablespoons lard and blend in with your fingertips until combined. Add wine and yolk and stir until a dough forms.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Form dough into a disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap, then let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Beat together ricotta, goat cheese, confectioners sugar, orange peel, orange-flower water, and cinnamon in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed 1 minute (do not overbeat). Fold in nuts and chocolate until combined and chill.
Set smooth rollers of pasta maker at widest setting. Unwrap dough and cut in half, then lightly flour 1 piece (keep remaining half covered with plastic wrap). Flatten floured dough into an oval and feed through rollers. Turn dial down 2 notches and feed dough through rollers again. Continue to feed dough through rollers, making space between rollers narrower by 2 notches each time, until narrowest setting is used.
Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Transfer rolled dough to a lightly floured surface and cut out 4 or 5 rounds with floured cutter. Transfer rounds to baking sheet and keep covered with more plastic wrap. Roll out remaining dough and cut rounds in same manner. Gather scraps and let stand 10 minutes. Roll out scraps and cut in same manner.
Heat remaining lard with 1 1/4 inches oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until it registers 350 degrees F on thermometer.
Meanwhile, lightly oil cannoli tubes. Lightly beat egg white, then brush bottom edge of 1 dough round with egg white. Wrap dough around a tube, overlapping ends (egg-white edge should go on top), then press edges together to seal. Make 5 more shells in same manner (keep remaining rounds covered with plastic).
Fry dough on tubes 1 at a time, turning with metal tongs, until 1 shade darker, about 45 seconds. Wearing oven mitts, clamp end of hot tubes, 1 at a time, with tongs and, holding tube vertically, allow shell to slide off tube onto paper towels, gently shaking tube and wiggling shell as needed to loosen. (If you allow shell to cool it will stick to tube and shatter when you try to remove it.) Transfer shells to paper towels to drain and cool tubes before reusing. Wrap remaining dough around tubes and fry in same manner.
Spoon filling into pastry bag and pipe some into 1 end of a cannoli shell, filling shell halfway, then pipe into other end. Repeat with remaining shells.

Grilled Pound Cake with Pineapple  inchSalsa inch and Tequila Whipped Cream
3/4 cup heavy (whipping) cream
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon tequila (preferably gold)
8 slices pound cake (each 1/2 inch thick)
2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Pineapple  inchSalsa inch
4 fresh mint sprigs, for garnish

1. Place the cream in a chilled mixer bowl or in a large metal bowl. Beat with a mixer until soft peaks form, starting on the slow speed and gradually increasing the speed to high. The total beating time will be 6 to 8 minutes. When soft peaks have formed, add the confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and tequila. Continue beating the cream until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes longer. Don't overbeat the cream or it will start to turn to butter. The tequila whipped cream can be made several hours ahead. Refrigerate it, covered, until ready to serve.
2. Lightly brush each slice of pound cake with butter on both sides. Cook the pound cake, following the instructions below for any of the grills, until lightly toasted. If desired, rotate each slice a quarter turn after 1 minute to create a handsome crosshatch of grill marks. You may need to cook the pound cake slices in more than one batch.
3. Place the pound cake slices on plates. Top each serving with a spoonful of Pineapple  inchSalsa inch and a dollop of tequila whipped cream, garnish with a sprig of mint, and serve at once.
Preheat the grill; if your contact grill has a temperature control, preheat the grill to high. Place the drip pan under the front of the grill. When ready to cook, lightly oil the grill surface. Place the slices of pound cake on the hot grill, then close the lid. The pound cake will be done after cooking 2 to 4 minutes.
Place the grill pan on the stove and preheat it to medium-high over medium heat. When the grill pan is hot a drop of water will skitter in the pan. When ready to cook, lightly oil the ridges of the grill pan. Place the slices of pound cake in the hot grill pan. They will be done after cooking 2 to 4 minutes per side.
Preheat the grill to high, then, if it does not have a nonstick surface, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the pound cake slices on the hot grate. They will be done after cooking 2 to 4 minutes per side.
Preheat the grill to high; there's no need to oil the grate. Place the pound cake slices on the hot grill. They will be done after cooking 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Rake red hot embers under the gridiron and preheat it for 3 to 5 minutes; you want a hot, 2 to 3 Mississippi fire. When ready to cook, brush and oil the gridiron. Place the pound cake slices on the hot grate. They will be done after cooking 2 to 4 minutes per side.

1/2 cup plus 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
5 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
Unsweetened cocoa power, for garnish
Eight 6-ounce aluminum tins

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bring a pan of water barely to a simmer. Place the chocolate and butter in a double boiler or metal mixing bowl and place over the pan of hot but not simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has melted but is not too hot. Stir until smooth.

1 teaspoon vanilla
3 large egg yolks
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup cake flour (not self-rising)
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon plus 4 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 cups raspberries
1 tablespoon Chambord if desired

Have ready meringue and cake roll. In a small bowl stir together yogurt, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon sugar.
In a large bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer beat cream and 2 teaspoons sugar until cream just holds stiff peaks. Crumble meringue into 1/2-inch pieces and gently fold into whipped cream. Reserve 1/2 cup raspberries and add remaining berries and yogurt mixture to whipped cream mixture. Gently fold mixture until just combined.
Unroll cake roll on kitchen towel and brush inside with Chambord. Gently spoon whipped cream mixture lengthwise along center of cake and roll cake around filling so that long edges just come together. Place roulade, seam side down, on a platter and chill 1 hour to facilitate slicing.
Just before serving, sprinkle roulade with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar. Cut roulade into slices (each a little less than 1 1/2 inches thick) serve with some reserved berries.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat whites on high speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar and continue beating until whites hold soft peaks. Add sugar and beat until meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil and on it spread meringue about 1/2 inch thick (shape does not matter). Bake meringue in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until crisp. Turn off oven and let meringue stand 1 hour. Remove meringue from oven and cool completely on baking sheet on a rack.
Carefully peel parchment paper or foil and put meringue, flat side up, on a work surface. In a small heavy saucepan melt chocolate over low heat, stirring occasionally, and spread on meringue in a thin layer. Chill meringue until chocolate is set, about 10 minutes. (Meringue may be made 1 week ahead and kept in a sealed plastic bag in a cool place.)

In a small saucepan bring water to a boil over moderate heat. Remove pan from heat and stir in cocoa powder and vanilla until smooth.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat yolks and 1/3 cup sugar on high speed until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Add cocoa mixture and beat until mixture is thick again, 3 to 5 minutes. Add flour and salt and beat 1 minute. (If using a standing electric mixer, transfer mixture to a large shallow bowl better suited to folding.)
In a medium bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites on high speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar and continue beating until whites hold soft peaks. Add remaining 1/3 cup sugar and beat until meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks.
Stir about one fourth whites into cocoa mixture to lighten and fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Spoon batter into a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and, holding bag with tip about 1/2 inch from surface of pan, pipe lengthwise in side-by-side strips, filling pan. (Alternatively, batter may be gently spread into pan.) Bake cake 8 minutes, or until it springs back when touched lightly in center with finger.

1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 ounce cream cheese, cut into small pieces, frozen
1 large egg, beaten to blend
1/2 ounce bittersweet (not unsweetened) or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 egg white, beaten to blend
1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam
9 ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened) or semisweet chocolate, chopped
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
3 tablespoons whipping cream
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam
1 1/2-pint basket raspberries
Lightly sweetened whipped cream

Position rack in lowest third of oven. Set cookie sheet on rack and preheat to 375 degrees F. Remove bottom from 10 1/2x9 1/2-inch heart-shape tart pan with 1-inch-high sides and removable bottom. Place bottom on parchment and trace heart shape.
Finely chop nuts with sugar in processor. Add flour, cinnamon, salt, cloves and ginger. Process just to blend. Add butter and cream cheese to processor. Process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1 egg and chocolate. Process, using on/off turns, until large moist clumps form.
To form top crust, transfer 1 1/3 cups dough to pastry bag fitted with no. 4 (3/8-inch diameter) plain tip. Refrigerate remaining dough. Pipe 7 parallel diagonal lines about 3/4 inch apart across heart outline on parchment. Pipe border around edge of heart inside traced line, touching ends of diagonal lines (some dough may be left over in pastry bag). Freeze 10 minutes. Brush dough with some egg white. Slide parchment with heart onto heated cookie sheet and bake until crust is golden and edges are beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Run long thin spatula between crust and parchment to loosen crust. Slide parchment with heart-shape crust onto rack and cool completely. Maintain oven temperature.
Return removable bottom to heart pan. Press remaining dough onto bottom and 3/4 inch up sides of pan, using plastic wrap if necessary to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Freeze until dough is firm, about 10 minutes. Brush lightly with egg white. Set pan on heated cookie sheet and bake until crust is golden brown and sides are beginning to pull away from pan, about 23 minutes. Spread bottom crust evenly with 1/3 cup jam. Bake 3 more minutes. Cool crust completely on rack.
Stir chocolate, butter and cream in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth. Mix in 2 tablespoon jam. Cool slightly. Pour filling evenly into bottom crust; smooth top. Chill until filling is firm, about 30 minutes.
Spread remaining 1/3 cup jam over filling and outer edge of bottom crust. Carefully place cooled heart-shape top crust atop jam. Press gently to seal. Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)
Remove torte from pan. Transfer to platter. Let stand at room temperature 45 minutes. Arrange raspberries in row in first space between crust lines. Spoon whipped cream into pastry bag fitted with small star tip. Pipe row of small rosettes in second space between crust lines. Continue, alternating rows of raspberries and whipped cream rosettes between crust lines.

Rosewater Angel Food Cake
1 cup cake flour (not self-rising)
1 2/3 cups sugar
1 3/4 cups egg whites (about 13 large egg whites)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon rosewater (available at specialty foods shops) if desired
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup confectioner's sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon grenadine syrup
fresh raspberries for garnish
mint sprigs for garnish

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Sift the flour 3 times onto a sheet of wax paper. Sift together the sifted flour and 2/3 cup of the sugar onto another sheet of wax paper. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and the cream of tartar, and beat the mixture until it barely forms soft peaks. Beat in the remaining 1 cup of sugar, a little at a time, the rosewater, and the vanilla and beat the mixture until it holds soft peaks. Sift one fourth of the flour mixture over the whites, fold it gently but thoroughly, and sift and fold in the remaining flour mixture in the same manner. Spoon the batter into a very clean, ungreased tube pan, 10 by 8 1/4 by 4 1/4 inches, preferably with a removable bottom, smoothing the top, and rap the pan on a hard surface twice to remove any air bubbles. Bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until it is springy to the touch and a tester comes out clean. If the pan has feet invert it over a work surface; otherwise invert it over the neck of a bottle. Let the cake cool for at least 2 hours or overnight. Run a thin knife in a sawing motion around the edge of the pan and the tube to loosen the cake from the pan and invert the cake onto a cake plate.
In a small bowl stir together with a fork the confectioner's sugar, the lemon juice, and the grenadine syrup until the mixture is smooth.
Pour the glaze over the cake, let the cake stand for 10 minutes, or until the glaze is set, and garnish it with the raspberries and the mint.

In bowl of a standing electric mixer combine eggs and sugar and beat, beginning at moderate speed and gradually increasing to high speed, for a total of 9 to 10 minutes, or until very thick and pale and mixture forms a ribbon when beaters are lifted. Transfer egg mixture to a large bowl (for ease of folding).
Sift one third flour mixture over egg mixture and with a large rubber spatula fold in gently but thoroughly. Sift and fold remaining flour mixture into egg mixture in 2 more batches in same manner. Fold in butter and vanilla gently but thoroughly.
Divide batter between pans, smoothing tops, and bake in middle of oven, rotating pans on oven rack after 15 minutes (to ensure even baking), a total of 25 to 30 minutes, or until cake is springy to the touch and a tester comes out clean. Cool cake layers in pans on racks 10 minutes and invert onto racks. Peel off paper and cool completely. Layers may be made 1 day ahead of cake assembly and kept, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, at room temperature.
With a long serrated knife halve each cake layer horizontally to make a total of 4 layers. Put 1 cake layer, cut side up, on a serving plate and top with half of reserved strawberry slices, arranging them in an even layer. Drizzle half of reserved strawberry liquid evenly over berries.
Top filling with second cake layer, cut side down. Whisk custard until smooth and spread layer evenly with custard. Top custard with third cake layer, cut side up. Spread layer evenly with remaining strawberries and drizzle with remaining strawberry liquid. Top filling with remaining cake layer, cut side down. Chill cake, covered with plastic wrap, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
In a chilled bowl beat cream with sugar until cream just holds stiff peaks.
