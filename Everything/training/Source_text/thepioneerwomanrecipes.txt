Stem strawberries and slice them in half from bottom to top.
 Place into a bowl and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons sugar.
 Stir together and let sit for 30 minutes.
 After 30 minutes, mash the strawberries in two batches.
 Sprinkle each half with 1 tablespoons sugar and allow to sit for another 30 minutes.
Make icing: combine cream cheese, 2 sticks butter, sifted powdered sugar, vanilla, and dash of salt in a mixing bowl.
 Mix until very light and fluffy.
Slice cake in half through the middle.
 Spread strawberries evenly over each half (cut side up), pouring on all the juices.
 Place cake halves into the freezer for five minutes, just to make icing easier.
Remove from freezer.
 Use a little less than 1/3 of the icing to spread over the top of the strawberries on the bottom layer.
 Place the second layer on top.
 Add half of the remaining icing to the top spreading evenly, then spread the remaining 1/3 cup around the sides.
Leave plain OR garnish with strawberry halves.
IMPORTANT: Cake is best when served slightly cool.
 The butter content in the icing will cause it to soften at room temperature.
 For best results, store in the fridge!
That’s the Best Frosting I’ve Ever Had
5 Tablespoons Flour
1 cup Milk
1 teaspoon Vanilla
1 cup Butter
1 cup Granulated Sugar (not Powdered Sugar!)

Bake your favorite chocolate cake and let it cool.
 In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens.
 You want it to be very thick, thicker than cake mix, more like a brownie mix is.
 Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
 (If I'm in a hurry, I place the saucepan over ice in the sink for about 10 minutes or so until the mixture cools.
) It must be completely cool before you use it in the next step.
 Stir in vanilla.
 While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.
 You don't want any sugar graininess left.
 Then add the completely cooled milk/flour/vanilla mixture and beat the living daylights out of it.
 If it looks separated, you haven't beaten it enough! Beat it until it all combines and resembles whipped cream.
Grab a spoon and taste this wonderful goodness.
 If there is any left after your taste test, spread it on a cooled chocolate cake.
 Cut yourself a piece and put it on a pretty plate.
 Grab a fork and prepare to experience the most divine pairing you can imagine.
 This frosting on chocolate cake is to die for.
 Sure, the recipe sounds strange -- it has flour in it -- but it's sublime.
 Try it, you'll see.
 You'll love it so much you won't go back.
 Oct 2015 update: TIPS! Use only real butter!! (My personal preference is the organic salted butter from Costco as to me it has a more rich and buttery taste.
) Do not use margarine, tub spreads, Country Crock, etc as the frosting is likely to separate.
 Some people like to use superfine sugar instead of regular granulated sugar, or to run the granulated sugar through a food processor first to make their own superfine sugar.
 If you taste flour or paste when it's done, I suspect the flour/milk mixture didn't cook long enough, don't be in a hurry to bring the milk/flour to the thickened state, let it have time to cook that flour taste out as it thickens.
 Did you get lumps? whisk whisk whisk as it cooks! One person recommended using a hand mixer as it cooks to avoid lumps, Some people use 3 T of flour instead of 5.
 I've made it with soy milk, non-fat milk and all the way through to half-n-half and it's turned out great for me using any of those.
 I've put it in piping bags and decorated with it, I've left it on the counter and I've also refrigerated it.
 I'm not a professional baker and while I've never had this recipe fail, I highly recommend reading the comments, there are great tips and helpful comments! Some have recommendations for adding cocoa powder, cherry, fresh strawberries, using coconut oil, etc.
 One person used lavender and earl grey tea in it (I recommended she post that recipe!) Some people have put the sugar in with the milk/flour mixture instead of creaming it with the butter.
 (I've tried that and personally wasn't a fan as it completely changed the flavor, and texture, of the frosting in the end.
) Also, while I like this best on chocolate cake, you can use it on any flavor of cake.
 In fact, it's the original, very old, frosting for Red Velvet Cake.
 Yep, that's right! Cream cheese frosting is not the original frosting for Red Velvet :) Happy baking! Have fun, and enjoy!! ~MissyDew

Perfect Pound Cake
3 sticks Butter
3 cups Sugar
5 whole Eggs
1 teaspoon Butter Flavoring
2 teaspoons Lemon Flavoring
3 cups All-purpose Flour
1 cup Sprite, 7-UP, Or Sierra Mist

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Cream butter.
 Add sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing after each addition.
 Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing after each addition.
 Add butter and lemon extracts and mix well.
 Add flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.
 Add soft drink, then mix together until combined.
 Scrape sides of bowl, then mix briefly.
Pour into a greased Bundt pan and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, until the cake is no longer jiggly.
Remove cake from oven and invert pan until cake drops out.
 Slice and chow down!
Pistachio Cake
1 box White Cake Mix
1 package (4 Ounce) Pistachio Instant Pudding Mix
1/2 cup Orange Juice
1/2 cup Water
1/2 cup Vegetable Oil
4 whole Eggs
3/4 cups Chocolate Syrup (such As Hershey's)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
 Grease and flour bundt pan.
 Mix all ingredients but chocolate syrup and beat for two minutes on medium-high.
 Pour 3/4 of the batter into the bundt pan.
 Add chocolate syrup to the remaining batter and mix well.
 Pour chocolate-laced batter on top of the pistachio batter.
Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.
 Note: You can use a knife to swirl chocolate batter into the pistachio batter for more of a marbled design.

Halloween Cake Balls
1 box Cake Mix (red Velvet Or Yellow About 18 Ozs))
1 can Frosting (store Bought 12 Ozs)
1 bag Melting Chocolate (12 Ozs. Any Color Or Combination Of Colors)
1 bag Lollipop Sticks
Various Tubes Gel Icing (any Colors)

Just prepare the cake according to the directions on the package, and bake it in a 9 x 13-inch pan.
 Cover the cake with a dishtowel and allow to cool completely.
Once the cake has cooled, begin gently crumbling the cake.
 Place sections of the cake into a large bowl, 1/4 of the cake at a time.
 When you’re finished, you should have a bunch of very fine cake crumbs.
Use two forks to work the icing into the cake.
 Keep working until the icing is no longer visible.
 Even if you use white icing with devil’s food, the white will eventually blend in entirely.
Next, roll the mixture into balls—make them about walnut size – a small ice cream scoop could help with this.
This is important: pop ‘em in the freezer, uncovered, for at least an hour.
 The cake balls need to be very firm before coating them.
When the cake balls are nice and firm, go ahead and prepare a double boiler.
Dump the melting chocolate pieces into the bowl of the double boiler.
 Stir occasionally until the chocolate is totally melted and smooth and set aside.
Insert a stick sideways into each ball (paying attention to the flat part on the bottom).
 Now, you can either roll the ball in the chocolate, or spoon it over the top—whatever’s easier for you.
Be sure to thoroughly coat the bottom of the ball where it meets the stick.
Lay them back down onto waxed or parchment paper, paying attention to the flat part (get it against the parchment again.
)Now decorate and get creative as you want!

 (Note: this recipe may be halved for a smaller pan, as this recipe feeds an army.
)Pour the thick cake batter into the pan.
 (It’s much thicker than regular cake batters.
) With a knife or offset spatula, spread the cake batter evenly over the pan.
Place the pan into a preheated 350-degree oven and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.
 I baked mine for exactly 20 minutes, so you probably want to start checking then.
To make the cream cheese frosting, in a mixing bowl, add cream cheese and butter.
 Whip to combine.
 Add powdered sugar and vanilla.
 Mix until thoroughly combined, scraping the sides once during mixing.
Put about 1/2 the frosting on the cake.
 Mark off the area of the stars with a toothpick.
 (No need to be proportionately accurate; just guesstimate.
) Prepare a pastry bag with a large star tip and fill up to 2/3 with icing.
 Fold down both corners to keep icing from splurging out the top.
Gripping the folded-down end tightly under fingertips and start squeezing two lines of frosting at the bottom of the cake.
 Make two rows of raspberries on the cake, then add another two lines of frosting.
Keep repeating: two lines of frosting, two lines of raspberries, two lines of frosting, etc.
Fill the square in the corner with a nice layer of blueberries.
 With the star tip, squeeze little dollops of frosting all over the blueberries.
Variation: Simply frost the cake with all the icing and sprinkle raspberries and blueberries randomly and generously all over the cake.

 Allow it to melt and bubble up for 3 to 4 minutes, swirling the pan to keep the butter moving around.
 When the butter is a medium golden brown, remove the pan from the heat (it will continue browning in the pan over the next 30 seconds or so!) Pour butter (and any solids in the bottom of the pan) into a heatproof bowl and allow it to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
 Meanwhile, allow the other stick of butter to soften.
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees*.
Cream the softened butter together with the brown sugar and regular sugar until it's nice and combined.
 Add the eggs and vanilla, and beat until smooth, scraping the bowl if necessary to make sure everything is incorporated.
 With the mixer on medium-low, slowly drizzle in the cooled melted butter, making sure to add all the darker brown solids.
 Scrape the bowl the mix again for 20-30 seconds, until everything is combined.
 In a separate bowl, combine the flour, coffee granules, baking soda and salt.
 Stir together, then add it in 1/3 increments, mixing on low, until it's totally incorporated.
 Scrape the bowl and beat for a few more seconds.
 Stir in the M&M's and the chocolate chips, if using.
 (I think using half chocolate chips, half M&M's would be perfect.
) In batches, scoop by heaping teaspoon onto a baking sheet lined with a baking mat, Press 2 to 3 additional M&M's on top if desired.
 If you have time, refrigerate scooped dough for 10 minutes (if not, it's fine.
) Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until deep golden brown.
 Wait a minute or two, then transfer cookies to a cooling rack.
 Repeat with the rest of the dough.
 Serve cookies with a big glass of cold milk!*You can bake at 350 for a little longer if you don't want the cookies to be quite so brown.
 (I like brown cookies!)

Quick Candy Cookies
Refrigerator Cookie Dough
Miniature Chocolate Candies

Slice the cookie dough into 1 to 1 ½ inch slices.
 Lay the slices on their side and cut them into quarters.
 Place each quarter into a greased mini-muffin tin.
 Peel the wrapper from as many pieces of candy as cookies you’re going to make.
 (Don’t be afraid to try different combinations of candies and dough.
)Bake the cookie dough in a 350-degree oven for just a few minutes, about 6 to 8 at the most.
 You’ll want to take them out just when they start to turn golden.
Almost as soon as you pull the warm cookies from the oven, begin lightly pressing one piece of candy into each cookie.
 The warmer the cookies, the better.
 They’ll grab onto the pieces of candy and work their magic, making the candy nice and soft and melty.
 And ridiculous.
When they’re all done, carefully remove from muffin tins with a spoon and arrange on a nice decorative platter.

Sylvia’s Perfect Pie Crust
1-1/2 cup Crisco (vegetable Shortening)
3 cups All-purpose Flour
1 whole Egg
5 Tablespoons Cold Water
1 Tablespoon White Vinegar
1 teaspoon Salt

In a large bowl, with a pastry cutter, gradually work the Crisco into the flour for about 3 or 4 minutes until it resembles a coarse meal.
 In a small bowl, beat an egg with a fork and then pour it into the flour/shortening mixture.
 Add 5 tablespoons of cold water, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt.
 Stir together gently until all of the ingredients are incorporated.
Separate the dough into thirds.
 ***Note: Separating it into thirds will result in three thin crusts.
 If you prefer a more substantial crust, separate it in half.
*** Form 3 evenly sized balls of dough and place each dough into a large Ziploc bag.
 Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough (about ½ inch thick) to make rolling easier later.
 Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them.
 (If you will be using it immediately it’s still a good idea to put in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes to chill.
)When you are ready to use the dough to make a crust, remove from the freezer and allow to thaw for 15 minutes.
 On a floured surface roll the dough, starting at the center and working your way out.
 (Sprinkle some flour over top of the dough if it’s a bit too moist.
) If the dough is sticking to the countertop use a metal spatula and carefully scrape it up and flip it over and continue rolling until it’s about ½ inch larger in diameter than your pie pan.
With a spatula, lift the dough carefully from the surface of the counter into the pie pan.
 Gently press the dough against the corner of the pan.
 Go around the pie pan pinching and tucking the dough to make a clean edge.
